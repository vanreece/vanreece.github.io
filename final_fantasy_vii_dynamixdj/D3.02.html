--Items - Save Crystal, Guard Source x 3, Mind Source x2, Magic Source,
          Elixir, Power Source x 2, HP Absorb Materia, Megalixir, Hero Drink


 NOTE - Aside from the trophy related side-quests (reach Lv 99, obtain
        99,999,99 gil etc.) the ONLY optional quests that the game has left
        to offer is the Emerald and Ruby WEAPON quests. Technically speaking,
        as far as super-mega bosses go they aren't that hard to defeat, they
        just require A LOT of preparation. More on that to come.

  Before descending you are going to want to set up a party, and this time
you don't have a say in who you bring. You HAVE to bring along Cait Sith and
Barret. The reason being is that we'll be able to (legitimately) duplicate
some of the items that are obtainable down below, but to do this we must have
certain players 'not' in our party. It'll make more sense later on, just
trust me for now, my set-up is as follows:

 1) Cloud - Lv 61 (Front)

     Ragnarok      - Elemental=Typoon, Enemy Skill, Double Cut, MP Turbo=KOTR
     Dragon Armlet - All=Restore, Sneak Attack=Mug, EXP Plus, HP Plus
     Safety Bit

 2) Barret - Lv 55 (Back)
                                                       Enemy Skill, Manipulate
     Max Ray         - Elemental=Alexander, Steal as well=Deathblow,
     Wizard Bracelet - Added Effect=Destruct, Added Cut=Deathblow, Morph,
     Ribbon                                          Sense, Luck Plus, HP Plus

 3) Cait Sith - Lv 54 (Front)
                                       Magic Counter, Enemy Skill, Enemy Skill
     Starlight Phone - Elemental=Choco/Mog, Final Attack=Revive, Quadra Magic,
     Mystile         - Mime, Mug, W-Item, Slash-All, Speed Plus, HP Plus
     Safety Bit

 NOTES - Make sure to have two identical Enemy Skills equipped to one
         character. If one Enemy Skill has learned a move that the other
         hasn't, then the skill won't be learned.

       - Quadra Magic can be a pain to master 2 copies of, so I suggest
         equipping it now for the AP. Same goes for KOTR (Knights of The
         Round), and Magic Counter (if you were able to obtain one from the
         Gold Saucer).

Before heading down the rope ladder, head into operations to restore your
HP/MP and save. To access the North Crater you must hover the Highwind over
it and press cancel to descend into the realms of insanity.

Once you've climbed down the rope ladder, head south. When prompted to,
choose 'let's go' to descend into the crater. In the next screen, you could
head through then opening to return to the Highwind if you wanted to,
otherwise open the chest for the [SAVE CRYSTAL].

 NOTES - The Save Crystal can be used anywhere within the North Crater to
         create a save point in a location of your desire. It can only be used
         once, and I strongly recommend using it near the screen where you
         encounter the Magic Pots and Movers. I'll explain why shortly.

       - The Save Crystal can be duplicated using an exploit, see section
         E.18 for more info.

       - THERE IS A GLITCH that sometimes occurs when you use your Save
         Crystal, involving you being unable to escape from the North Crater
         for good, so *be sure* to save into a new file when you do use it!!!

Now make your way anti-clockwise until you come to a chest containing a
[GUARD SOURCE]. Keep proceeding downwards until you come to the next screen
(don't forget to manipulate the Dark Dragon to learn Dragon Force and Laser,
and the Parasite to learn L5 Death and Magic Breath).

Head right first and keep dropping down until you reach a chest containing a
[GUARD SOURCE]. Then drop down even further for a [MIND SOURCE].

Now make your way left and climb up the ridges to reach the visible chest
containing a [MAGIC SOURCE]. Keep heading up for two more chests, one
containing an [ELIXIR] and the other a [POWER SOURCE].

Notice the blue orb embedded into the rocks? Before jumping down from the
Power Source chest run behind the rocks to grab the [HP ABSORB MATERIA]. Now
you can descend to the next screen (it's quicker to climb back up and head to
the right).

Drop down from the ledge then head to the right. Drop down to reach a chest
containing a [MIND SOURCE]. Then inch to the right, but before dropping down
jump up to the left. Follow the path to drop down to the other side, then
enter into the cave to find a chest containing a [MEGALIXIR].

Back out of the cave and drop down on the left. Then head to the right to
open the chest containing a [HERO DRINK].

Now head into the cave and open the visible chest for a [GUARD SOURCE]. Then
head upwards and enter the hole you see to find a chest containing a [POWER
SOURCE]. Now head out of the northern exit.

Head over to the right and drop down twice. Go through the opening to enter
the cave once more, then head south through the opening. Keep dropping down
until you come to the next screen, which will be a meeting point for you and
your buddies.

We have now come to the infamous left & right fork option of the North
Crater. It is here that you will have the choice to send your squad in
different directions, and as your teammates go off in their respective
directions they will pick up various items for you long the way.

 NOTE - I have always used my Save Crystal here when playing as a kid. *DO
        NOT* I repeat *DO NOT* use it here.

] SIDE NOTE - THE {LEFT AND RIGHT FORK}                                      [
]                                                                            [
] You now have two paths to choose from, the right path, and the left path.  [
] If you choose to take the left path, then you will have another two paths  [
] to choose from (upper-left and lower-left). You also have to choose which  [
] path to send your teammates on, and depending on which route you sent them [
] on will depend on the items that they obtain, which can then be            [
] duplicated. The results are as follows:                                    [
]                                                                            [
]  NOTES - If you travel the same route that you send a teammate on then     [
]          that teammate will not collect any items on that route for you,   [
]          meaning you cannot duplicate that item.                           [
]                                                                            [
]        - If you send Yuffie on her own, then she will not hand over any    [
]          Materia to you that she found. Always send her with someone else. [

] The main problem here is Vincent. You're going to have to make a choice on [
] whether you want to lose a duplicate of the Mega All Materia, the Imperial [
] Guard or the Mystile.                                                      [
]                                                                            [
] Mega All - This will make nearly very attack you perform hit every enemy,  [
]            including Deathblow, Morph even your basic attacks! But to be   [
]            honest, as long as you have one other person with Slash-All and [
]            the other with Mime, you don't really need to duplicate this    [
]            item, especially seeing as you can master it for a second and   [
]            third copy.                                                     [
]                                                                            [
] Imperial Guard - This piece of armour has the highest defence in the game  [
]                  to have 6 Materia slots, and as such is definitely worth  [
]                  getting a second and third copy now (assuming you         [
]                  obtained your first copy by fighting the CMD. Grand Horn  [
]                  earlier on at the Fort Condor Huge Materia mission).      [
]                                                                            [
] Mystile - Regarded as the best piece of armour in the game, this little    [
]           beauty gives you amazing Defence% and Magic Def%, meaning the    [
]           enemies will have a very difficult time attacking you. Make sure [
]           to send Tifa right and to not travel that way yourself.          [
]                                                                            [
] To conclude, you're going to want to send your characters as follows:      [
]                                                                            [
]  Tifa     - Right      - Mystile                                           [
]  Red XIII - Upper-Left - Shield Materia                                    [
]  Yuffie   - Upper-Left - Counter Materia                                   [
]  Cid      - Upper-Left - Imperial Guard                                    [
]  Vincent  - Upper-Left - Magic Source                                      [
]                                                                            [
] So, you're going to want to send everyone along the left path with the     [
] exception of Tifa (who travels the right path alone), and then at the      [
] second fork you're going to want to send everyone along the upper-left     [
] path with the exception of Cloud, Barret and Cait Sith, who travel along   [
] the lower-left path.                                                       [
]                                                                            [
] If you're feeling incredibly brave you could send Barret and Cait Sith     [
] with Tifa along the right path and then travel alone for an extra Guard    [
] Source and Elixir, but c'mon, it's really not that worth it. Also, make    [

So, after sending Tifa right (by herself) and after everyone else left, head
to the left path yourself. Then send everyone else on the upper path leaving
Cloud, Barret and Cait Sith on the lower path.

 NOTES - If you are playing on the Steam/PS4 version then a small easter egg
         will occur when you create your save point in this cavern (the room
         with the second fork). The area will be titled as 'Secret Cow Level'
         in the menus, which is a reference to the game Diablo. When you
         leave then reenter the area, the name will revert back to default. I
         advise on saving your Save Crystal for a little later.

       - I had to mention this. A very funny post left by Silver_Dragon_ on
         GameFaq message boards reads:

  Cloud:  "Let's split up into 2 teams. Team 1 will consist of myself,
           Barret, Red XIII, Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent and Cid.
           Team 2 will consist of... Tifa."                                lol

--Items - Elixir, Remedy, X-Potion x 2, Turbo Ether x 2, Vaccine, Magic
          Counter Materia, Mega All Materia, Speed Source


  After jumping down the rocks head over to the right to pick up a chest
containing an [ELIXIR]. Then head over to the left for a chest containing a
[REMEDY], and finally search the third chest at the bottom of the screen to
find an [X-POTION] inside. Now head south to the next screen.

Run straight down to jump off at the end of the raised circular platform to
land to the right of the chest containing a [TURBO ETHER]. If you jumped off
early and landed above the chest then you can make your way round to the
chest following the right path, otherwise head to the right for another chest
holding a [VACCINE].

Now head over to the Lifestream waterfall, and on the very left you should
just be able to make out the [MAGIC COUNTER MATERIA], although it is very
difficult to spot. GRAB THAT MATERIA! and start Leveling it up straight sway!

Follow the path to the next screen, then jump down do grab an [X-POTION].
Keep following the path round until you grab the chest containing a [TURBO
ETHER] (who puts all the chests down here anyway?).

For this next bit you have to time when you press confirm in order to GRAB
THAT MATERIA! the [MEGA ALL MATERIA] that you see floating in front of the
Lifestream waterfall. Just before you hear the first footstep sound effect,
press confirm. Once you've obtained it, pick up the chest on the left for a
[SPEED SOURCE].

] Deathblow will now hit all targets. Also, every magic spell will now hit   [
] all targets so long as the magic spell is compatible with All.             [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

I swapped Barret's Sense for the Mega All, this really is one of the best
Materias in the game. Now head through to the next screen and *STOP! TURN
AROUND* and head back the way you came until you come to the second fork,
then take the upper-left path saving along the way.

 NOTES - If you were to have headed clockwise around the Bottom of the
         Northern Cave area you would  have triggered your allies to join you.
         This would subsequently remove the items from the field, but only
         *after* you've received the items from them, and *only* the item that
         they give you is removed, as you receive it.

       - BUT! If you were to trigger your comrades to join, then head back
         up to the top fork *before* receiving their items, they will *not*
         hand anything over.

       - You must have entered into this final bottom screen (where the music
         stops) before making your way back up.

--Items - Magic Source, Remedy, Vaccine, Shield Materia, Imperial Guard, Hero
          Drink, W-Magic Materia, Counter Materia


 NOTE - If you hadn't visited the screen at the bottom of the crater then you
        will not be allowed to visit the upper-left area. Cloud will simply
        say "Cid will handle this" (or whichever party member you sent down
        that path).

  It's in these first two screens that you'll be spending a fair amount of
time grinding in. Just remember to save every few battles or so, there's
nothing worse than having a Magic pot steal one your most valuable weapons,
forcing you to re-load your previous save, unless of course you've been
saving regularly. Note that you cannot PHS whilst in the North Crater.

 NOTES - I advise on using your Save Crystal in the first screen, near the
         entrance. *SAVE INTO NEW SLOT* to avoid the glitch as previously
         mentioned, and also just in case you sent somebody the wrong way by
         mistake.

       - You'll be interested to know that the first screen actually has a
         higher encounter rate than the second, so if you do come back here
         to train later on then that's the screen to run around on!

First head right and jump over to the visible chest for a [MAGIC SOURCE],
then head to the left and jump up to the slightly raised area. As you run
north you'll dive into the water, emerging on the pathway to the right.
follow the path round to the left for a chest containing a [REMEDY].

Now make your way east to the next screen. As you enter, head north west
first to the far chest containing a [VACCINE]. Then head round to the rock
face and GRAB THAT MATERIA!, the [SHIELD MATERIA] that you see sitting there.

From the rack face, head south west to dive into the water again, you will
emerge at the nearest chest which contains the amazing [IMPERIAL GUARD]. Dive
back into the water then climb the rock face to the top (or alternatively
dive into the water from the other side to emerge near the exit).

Now head back to the middle fork this time heading right to a chest
containing a [HERO DRINK]. Then make your way north and east to the next
screen.

Just to the north beneath the undergrowth you should be able to make out the
purple orb, this is the [W-MAGIC MATERIA]. Now head to the left but before
going through the opening, head down to the centre of the glowing Lifestream
to pick up the [COUNTER MATERIA]. This is the last piece of Materia in the
game. GRAB THAT LAST MATERIA! You still have the 'Master Materia' to obtain,
but they are not obtained through conventional means; more to follow.

 NOTE - (Command) Counter is a support Materia that can be linked with moves
        such as Mug, Morph, Deathblow etc. I suggest equipping with Deathblow
        right away.

You don't need to head through the opening on the left as it will lead down
to the bottom of the Northern Cave area, so instead turn around and start
making your way back to the initial fork, this time taking the right path
(saving along the way).

 NOTE - Ok, so I've read a few reports saying that the Dragon Zombie will
        very un-occasionally use Pandora's Box a second time, I've also read
        reports saying that it's never used it because he was defeated too
        quickly on the first encounter, and they were never able to complete
        their Enemy Skill Materia on that play-through. These are all false;
        it is scripted into the enemy AI for Pandora's Box to be used as a
        finishing move *every time you encounter it*, UNLESS the 'Pandora's
        Box' flag is highlighted. This flag is highlighted automatically
        after the move is cast the first time, thereby making it impossible
        to be used again. It IS possible for the Dragon Zombie's skill power
        to be used up; if this happens, reload.

--Items - Mystile, Elixir, Speed Source, Tetra Element, Megalixir x 2,
          Luck Source


  First make your way down the spiralling path to the next screen. When
prompted, jump down to the landing below. First open the chest on your left
for the [MYSTILE], then grab the [ELIXIR] on the right. I suggest equipping
the Mystile straight way.

Keep spiralling your way down to the next screen to grab the visible chest
containing a [SPEED SOURCE] (it seems as though the North Crater is the
'source' for Sources, aside from the Gelnika that is). Now head over south
east for a chest containing the [TETRA ELEMENT]. Tetra Elements can also be
morphed from the Cactuer on an island south of Cosmo Canyon.

Now head north until you come to a chest containing a [MEGALIXIR].

Then run south slightly, and head all the way west to reach another chest
containing a another [MEGALIXIR], then make your way back east and then north
to the next screen.

 NOTE - There should only be four enemies left to obtain Enemy Skills from,
        see the enemy listings above. By the time you reach the 'meeting
        point' in the bottom screen you should have obtained all Enemy Skills!

Make your way down the huge bone structure until you come to the bottom of
the northern cave area once more. As you make your way round, pick up the
[LUCK SOURCE] from the chest. You've now finished collecting all the items
from the North Crater, hoo-rah! Head clockwise around the opening to trigger
your comrades to appear.

 NOTE - Interesting fact, if you had decided to leave the crater and return
        to the Highwind prior to reaching the final screen, when you returned
        to the left and right fork, you would be able to re-select which
        paths you wanted to send everyone down. If however you'd decided to
        return to the Highwind *after* you'd reach the final screen (but
        before triggering everyone's appearance), then it would mess with the
        games mechanics slightly. When you did triggered everyone's
        appearance, the game would think that Cloud has travelled the right
        path, and sent everyone else left. You would then receive an item
        from each character (even the ones that travelled with you), and each
        item would have a 50/50 chance of being an item from the upper left
        path or the lower left path, regardless of which path you initially
        sent them down.

Now is the time to collect all of your duplicated items. If you've done
everything correctly then you can talk to:
Cid      for the Imperial Guard
Tifa     for the Mystile (although it'll read 'Mythril')
Red XIII for the Shield Materia
Vincent  for the Magic Source &
Yuffie   for the Counter Materia (although she'll be very reluctant to hand
                                  it over)

**DO NOT CONTINUE. YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN**

 NOTE - A glitch would have occurred if you had sent Cait Sith down the lower-
        left path; he would have handed over an X-Potion, although the Turbo
        Ether would have been removed from the field.

You are now going to want to make the long ascent out of the North Crater so
that you can PHS. The upcoming boss battle will be very unique in the sense
that you will be able to use more than one party whilst fighting it, so
you're going to want to set-up everyone beforehand (although you will get
another opportunity to later on, it's just easier to do it this way. Besides,
I'm itching to get Cait Sith out of my party now).

 NOTE - You actually have a choice to make. You can either finish the game
        now at a level where Sephiroth will still pose a challenge, THEN you
        can re-load your save to finish grinding for 99,999,999 gil, raising
        Cloud to level 99 and defeating Emerald and Ruby WEAPON. OR you can
        skip down to section D3.04 - The Final Grind now to do all the above
        and then come back to finish the game when you will be ridiculously
        over-powered, but for the sake of continuity I'd advise finishing the
        game now.
