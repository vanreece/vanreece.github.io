Make your way into the Temple of the Ancients. As you enter you'll have a
small amount of dialogue to read, you'll then have to place the keystone into
the alter. Once this is done you will be transported deep within the TOTA,
and you won't be able to leave until you've progressed with the story.

This area looks a lot less linear than it actually is. Follow the path to
descend down the vine, then head to the right for a chest containing the
[TRIDENT]. Then climb up the long vine to come to an impassable door. (I
believe the quote is a reference to the game Chrono Trigger).

Now climb the second vine to grab the [MIND SOURCE], then head through the
archway to the left. Here can talk to the weird looking Temple Keeper, then
talk to him a second time to either save, rest or buy a few items. When you
are finished grab the chest to the right for the [SILVER RIFLE].

Now head back out and down the vine, this time heading through the archway to
pick up the [TURBO ETHER]. Now head down the long flight of stairs and keep
following the path round to come to a chest containing the [ROCKET PUNCH].

Climb the small vine then head up the stairs and through the unmarked alcove.
Following it round to the right climb the large vine, then head to the end of
the path to GRAB THAT MATERIA! the [LUCK PLUS MATERIA] (even though it'll
read 'Lucky Plus Materia', fixed on the Steam PS4 version). If you miss this
piece here then you'll never be able to come back for it.

Now make your way back round to the marked alcove that the Temple Keeper went
through, we'll return to the visible chest very shortly.

This next room has a fairly obvious mini-game. Simply run at the right time
to avoid the rolling boulders, stopping to GRAB THE MATERIA! the [MORPH
MATERIA] (at last). When you make it to the other end the boulders will stop
falling and Aeris will get worried, then she'll insist that you look into the
pool of spirit energy.

] power, but if delivers the final blow then your opponent will be           [
] transformed into an item (if applicable, not all enemies can be morphed).  [
] Some of the items that are obtained this way can be incredibly valuable.   [
] Moves such as L4 Suicide, Demi and Laser help out also.                    [
]                                                                            [
]  NOTE - There is a weapon for Yuffie called the Conformer which is the     [
]         only weapon in the game that can Morph for normal damage, and      [
]         because of this awesomeness Yuffie will be in my final team.       [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

After you have viewed the events that have taken place, head right to the
Temple Keeper to rest and save, but you can no longer buy items from him
(what, did he lose his merchandise or something? Or did you just buy it
all...). Head down into the next room to enter into the clock room.

--Items - Nail Bat, Princess Guard, Ribbon, Trumpet Shell, Megalixir,
          Work Glove, Bahamut Materia,
--Boss  - Red Dragon Lv 39 (Dragon Armlet), Demons Gate Lv 45 (Gigas Armlet)


  Press:
   /_\ to move the clock hands manually
    O  to spin them randomly
    X  to proceed

  The first thing that you're going to want to do is to press X to proceed,
then stand on the hour hand and wait for the second hand to sweep you off.
When you land you'll have to fight 2 x Ancient Dragons, then you'll be able
to open the chest containing the [NAIL BAT]. (We're starting to complete our
collection of 0 slotted, high attack powered weapons)

Exit to find yourself back within the stairs and vines area (you just came
through the 'sealed' door from earlier). Make your way back round to the
boulder room and then save. Now head into the clock room and set the minute
hand to I.

Room I - Battle encounter with 1 x Jemnezmy and 2 x Toxic Frogs. Use Bio2
         to kill Jemnezmy instantly.

Now head back into the clock room and without changing the clock hands run
straight back into the boulder room. Then you can run back into the clock
room to just change the minute hand once, this is the quickest way of
navigating the Time Guardian. Save using the Temple Keeper, also.

Room II   - Dead End.

Room III  - Battle encounter with 2 x 8 eye. I suggest weakening them with
            moves like Matra Magic first, then just using morph so that you
            obtain a few Magic Sources. If you're not bothered by this then
            you can just use Bio2 to obliterate them. Their drain move is
            excellent for filling up Limit Breaks aswell.

Room IV   - Chest containing the [PRINCESS GUARD]. This is Aeris's ultimate
            weapon, equip it if you don't have the Umbrella for her. As with
            the Yoshiyuki, this weapon will double in power when one of
            Aeris's companions are KO'd, and will triple in power when 2 are
            KO'd.

Room V    - Leads back to the chest in the 'stairs and vines' area we saw
            earlier containing the [RIBBON]. Equip it now!

Room VI   - We'll return here shortly.

Room VII  - Chest containing the [TRUMPET SHELL].

Room VIII - Chest containing the Squall Lionheart. Joke, it's a [MEGALIXIR].

Room IX   - Dead End.

Room X    - Boulder Room.

Room XI   - Dead End.

Room XII  - We'll return here later.

]  NOTE - You can still inflict Fury and Sadness upon yourself as long as    [
]         you do so outside of battle. The Ribbon will only prevent an enemy [
]         from inflicting them upon you. Also, the Ribbon won't protect you  [
]         from Death, so using the Death Force E-Skill, or equipping Added   [
]         Effect=Destruct to one's armour would be advisable against enemies [
]         that can inflict instant death.                                    [

Head into room VI to find that the Temple Keeper has locked the door. There
are 9 exits here, and each exit will lead to another designated exit. You
must intercept the Temple Keeper by anticipating which exit he is going to

Once you've caught him he'll unlock the door for you. Don't forget that you
can jump down to the lower level on the left, do so to grab the chest at the
bottom for the [WORK GLOVE]. Rest and save, then head into the Mural room to
learn a great deal about Sephiroth's plan. After Cloud has had another little
episode, you'll eventually be face to face with:

GRAB THAT MATERIA! Once the battle has finished make sure to grab the
[BAHAMUT MATERIA] (unlocking the Waiting in the Wings Trophy). This bad-boy
summon is permanently missable.

Now head over to the right to inspect the floating object on the small alter.
You have to trust Cait Sith here, when you are ready, leave the Mural room.
It wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to battle around for a bit to try
and fill up your Limit Breaks before leaving. Heal and save aswell.

 NOTE - Just as in Sector 7 right at the beginning of the game, Aeris will be
        leaving your party again. And just like before, you are going to lose
        whatever Armour she is wearing, although her Materia and Accessory
        will be returned to you, so make sure that she isn't wearing
        something unique like the Edincoat. I equipped her with the Silver
        Armlet. The annoying thing is that we won't get a chance to un-equip
        Aeris after the upcoming Boss battle, so you'll have to step into it
        without your optimal set-up. Note that you can actually un-equip
        Aeris after the battle, but the window in which to do this is so
        tight that you'd be better off just playing it on the safe side by un-
        equipping her now. Give her a non-unique weapon, also.

Make your way back to the Clock Room to find that the hands are fixed at 12
o'clock. Equip the Bahamut Materia and head through to door 12, after an
amount of dialogue you'll be up against:

* If you're really struggling to defeat him then you can try slowing the     *

* Mural Room. Once he has been defeated you'll receive the [GIGAS ARMLET],   *
* which will boost you Strength by +30, but has 0 growth (so your Materia    *
* won't level up).                                                           *

After you have defeated the Demons Gate some crucially important events will
unfold. You won't need to pick up this walkthrough again until you have
regained control of Cloud in Gongaga Village.
