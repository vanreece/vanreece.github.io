Fancy something new? If you own either of the PC versions then you may wish
to explore some of the modifications that are available at

New Threat - A complete difficulty overhaul, the New Threat Mod is for those
             feeling a bit jaded with the game. Packed with new and revised
             enemies and bosses, new side-quests, optional cutscene skips and
             a whole lot more!

Beacause - Let's face it, an absolutely terrible job was done of the
           localisation, and many times we've found ourselves marvelling at
           blatant errors such as "This guy is sick". The 'beacause' mod is a
           complete front-to-back re-localisation, and every single text has
           been looked at and corrected based on the original Japanese.

--E.01 A - The Basics


  The first thing to point out is the fact that it's actually called the Gold
Saucer Dating Game, but in the interest of protecting those who are new to
the game I decided to change the title to something more obscure as to not
reveal anything.

Throughout the first two thirds of Disk 1 you will have many opportunities to
raise or lower certain character's affection towards you through the dialogue
choices you make, including choices regarding who you have in your party for
certain events. The character with the highest rating at the time in which
you re-visit the Gold Saucer after obtaining the Tiny Bronco will be chosen
as your lucky partner for the evening. There are only four characters however
that can be chosen as a date, and they are Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie & (even)
Barret. Their starting values are as follows:

 Aeris  - 50
 Tifa   - 30
 Yuffie - 10
 Barret - 0

If you wish to date either Aeris or Tifa then you won't really need a guide,
just be particularly pleasant to either character whilst being mean to
everybody else. If you wish to date Yuffie or Barret however then you
probably will need to use this guide. Note that if you date Tifa or Aeris
then you will experience dialogue within the date that is quite deep in
relation to the storyline, but if you date Yuffie or Barret then you will
have a much more comical experience.

 NOTE - If you have the PS4 version, then you will want Barret to win the
        Affection Game for the Best Bromance Trophy!

Red XIII, Cait Sith, Vincent and Cid do not have an affection rating
whatsoever, so nothing you do or say will affect them in any way shape or
form. If two of the applicable characters finish with matching values then
the character with the highest priority is chosen, and the priority order
goes Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie then Barret.

                                                                {Speed Dating}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.01 B - Speed Dating (The easy way to date a character)


Aeris: There is no secret to dating Aeris. She starts off 20 points in the
       lead so if you fail to date Aeris then you really need some lessons in
       courtesy.

Tifa: Whilst locked up in the Shinra HQ you can talk to Tifa an infinite
      amount of times to boost her score by +1 each time by selecting "Leave
      it to me". Selecting "Kinda hard" will lower her score by -1 each time.

Yuffie: Don't recruit Yuffie until you have passed Mt. Nibel. Then fight in
        the smaller of the two forests near Rocket Town to encounter Yuffie
        100% of the time. Respond correctly to the first four choices to gain
        +8 (2 per choice), then choose incorrectly for the final choice to
        have her steal some gil from you. Do this twice, then recruit her.
        She will then return all that she has stolen from you. Her affection
        rating cannot be raised higher than 30 this way, which is why there
        is no need to do this more than twice.

Barret: Make sure that Barret is in your party when you first enter Cosmo
        Canyon, then head over to the back of Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop to
        find Barret. Listen to him talk about Avalanche, then when prompted
        choose dialogue option 1 to hear more about his story, boosting his
        affection towards you by +3. When prompted a second time, choose
        option 2 "Yeah, whatever...", then run outside and back in again to
        reset the dialogue sequence. Keep doing this to raise Barret's
        affinity +3 each time.

        *DO NOT* attempt this if you are trying to achieve the Best Bromance
        Trophy, as reports suggest that doing so prevents the trophy from
        unlocking if Barret's affection rating exceeds its limit. Only
        attempt this if you have messed up your choices along the way, and
        don't want to start a fresh game.

          NOTE - Only characters in your party will be affected.

     24   When the old guy discusses his problem:
          - "All right"      BARRET +5,  AERIS +3,  TIFA +3  and/or  YUFFIE +2
          - "Not interested" BARRET -5,  AERIS -3,  TIFA -3  and/or  YUFFIE -2
          NOTE - Only characters in your party will be affected.

          This is basically the same responses for recruiting Yuffie:

     25a  After defeating the Mystery Ninja in the screen with the save point:
          - "All right"       NO EFFECT
          - "Not interested"  YUFFIE +2

     25b  After selecting "Not interested":
          - "......petrified"          YUFFIE +2
          - "You're gonna lose again"  NO EFFECT

     25c  After selecting "......petrified":
          - "Go ahead"        NO EFFECT
          - "Wait a second!"  YUFFIE +2

     25d  After selecting "Wait a second!":
          - "......That's right"  YUFFIE +2
          - "You kiddin'?"        NO EFFECT

     25e  After selecting "......That's right":
          - "......What's your name?"  NO EFFECT
          - "......Let's hurry on"     YUFFIE +2

          NOTE - You could purposely select the incorrect response on the
                 final choice if you wanted to. This will retain the +8
                 points for Yuffie that you have gained, you can then repeat
                 to keep raising her affection towards you indefinitely.

--D1.09 C - Cargo Ship

     26   When Yuffie asks for some Tranquilizers, choose:
          - "Here, use this"  YUFFIE +4
          - "Nope"            YUFFIE -2

          - "I'll take you someday"  AERIS +2
          - "I dunno..."             AERIS -2

     28   When Tifa remarks how much she hates war, choose:
          - "Yeah..."       TIFA +2
          - "I don't know"  TIFA -2

--D1.11 A - Gold Saucer

     29   The first character that you choose to talk to will get either +3
          or -2, depending on whether or not you choose them to accompany you.
          No other rating value shall change after the first dialogue choice
          has been made.

          NOTE - If you choose no-one then the person with the highest
                 affinity towards you will be chosen as your accompaniment.
                 If this person is Barret then Red XIII will be chosen.

--D1.11 B - Corel Prison

     30   The character chosen to accompany you to fight Dyne will receive:
          AERIS +10,  TIFA +3  or  YUFFIE +2

--D1.13 B - Gongaga Village

          Having Tifa and/or Aeris in your party when you first talk to
          Zack's parents will result in some optional dialogue with them:

     31a  Talk to Tifa:
          - "I just got lucky"      TIFA +1
          - "I worked hard for it"  TIFA +1

     31b  Talk to Aeris:
          - "Poor Guy"                 AERIS +1
          - "...jealous...envious..."  AERIS +2

          Should you choose to simply ignore either one of them then you will
          receive -3 for the character/s that you blanked (simply leave
          Gongaga without talking to them).

--D1.14 A - Welcome Home Nanaki

          Make sure that Barret is in your party when first entering Cosmo
          Canyon, then speak to him in the back of Tiger Lily's Weapon Store:

     32a  After Barret has finished talking for the first time:
          - "Go on"       BARRET +3 (GLITCHED use as many times as you like)
          - "Not Really"  NO EFFECT

     32b  After Barret has finished talking for the second time:
          - "And then"           BARRET +3
          - "Yeah, whatever..."  NO EFFECT  *Choose this option for the glitch

          After selecting Option 1 followed by option 2 you can leave and re-
          enter the room to repeat the dialogue sequence, gaining +3 each
          time. The glitch ends once you select option 1 twice consecutively.

--D1.18 A - Wutai

     33   Finishing Yuffie's sidequest will result in +10 for Yuffie.

WEIRDLY ENOUGH you do not receive any affection boost/drops for the choices
you make in the church in Sector 5 when you first meet Aeris, so you can go
ahead and call her a drunk if you like and it'll make no difference
whatsoever. Nor does the dialogue choices you make in Costa Del Sol have any
impact on the outcome. Lastly, Mt. Corel. It doesn't matter at all whether
you take the 10 Phoenix Downs or not, your characters will still love you
just the same (bizarre, I know).

--E.01 D - Hidden Extras


 If Tifa's affection value is above 50 after the date (even if she wasn't
your date) then you will get a slight variation in the scenes at the end of
Disk 2. This occurs when Cloud and Tifa get back on board the Highwind after
spending some alone time together.

If you were to raise Tifa's affection to above 120 before entering Gongaga
for the first time (by rinsing the exploit in the jail cells at the Shinra
HQ) then her dialogue will be slightly different. The same applies for Aeris,
although there is no possible way of raising her affection to 120 without
using cheats/game hacks.

Also coded into the game is a 'Battle Affection' system (Thank TFergusson for
his Gold Saucer Date Guide Faq for this info) that kept a separate score for
certain actions performed in-battle. This system was designed to run
coherently with the main scoring system, and when a date was chosen it
would've taken into account both values. As it transpires, the game still
keeps track of the four characters battle affection ratings, although they
are completely disregarded when a date is selected and as such serve no
purpose within the game whatsoever. The actions/rewards are as follows:

   - Cloud revives a teammate                     +4 Battle Affection
   - Cloud successfully uses Cover on a teammate  +3 Battle Affection
   - Cloud restores a teammates HP                +2 Battle Affection
   - Cloud wounds a teammate                      -2 Battle Affection
   - Cloud kills a teammate                       -4 Battle Affection
   - A teammate is KO'd at the end of a battle    -5 Battle Affection

--E.01 F -  Gold Saucer Date Script


  Ok, so there is a fair amount of script that takes place during the date
sequence, I only intend to narrate the bit that really matters - the
conversation on the Gondola. There is a fair amount of sub-context in regards
to Tifa's and Aeris's date, whereas Yuffie and Barret's date is purely
comical.

If I get a strong enough demand to, I will take the time to write up the
whole script of each date sequence, including the whole EDK bit, but only if
enough people want me to.

--E.02 A - About Limit Breaks


  Limit Breaks are powerful techniques that your players can use once their
Limit gauge has completely filled up. In order to fill up your Limit gauge
you must first receive enough damage; every time they get hit their Limit
gauge will fill up slightly. The rate at which the gauge fills is
proportionate to how much HP has been drained as a % of you max HP, aswell as
the current Limit level that you have set for that character. To use your
Limit Break you must select it as it appears in place of your basic attack,
should you wish to save your Limit for later on (for say, a boss) then you
will have to find a different command to select.

Here is a chart depicting how much HP must be drained for each character for
their Limit gauge to be filled up completely:

                      _______ _______ _______ _______
                     |       |       |       |       |
                     | Lv 1: | Lv 2: | Lv 3: | Lv 4: |
         +-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Cloud     | 47%   | 108%  | 144%  | 168%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Barret    | 43%   | 80%   | 124%  | 149%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Tifa      | 40%   | 111%  | 169%  | 188%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Aeris     | 66%   | 94%   | 107%  | 145%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Red XIII  | 65%   | 100%  | 129%  | 161%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Yuffie    | 66%   | 100%  | 133%  | 159%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Cait Sith | 53%   | 60%   | N/A   | N/A   |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Vincent   | 67%   | 81%   | 106%  | 141%  |
         |-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | Cid       | 66%   | 93%   | 126%  | 159%  |
         +-----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Note that all figures have been rounded. Also note that Tifa requires the
least amount of damage at level 1 whilst requiring the most amount of damage
at level 4.

When your gauge has been filled to the max and your Limit becomes available,
your gauge will start flashing rainbow colours. When this happens, the ATB
(Active Time Battle) gauge will fill up at twice its normal rate allowing you
to hastily use your Limit Break. Should you choose to save your Limit for
another turn, the ATB will not fill up as quickly again until you've used
your Limit and you've filled up the gauge once more. Once you have opted to
use your Limit Break the said character will take priority over every other
command, meaning he/she will always attack next even if it wasn't his/her
turn to do so.

There are two Statuses that can affect the rate in which your Limit gauge
fills up, these are Fury and Sadness. Fury will double the rate at which your
gauge will fill whilst at the same time reducing the player's accuracy by
30%, whereas Sadness will halve the time it takes for your Limit to fill
whilst reducing the amount of damage you take by 30%. You can inflict Fury on
a character by using a Hyper, which can also be used to cure you of Sadness.
You can inflict Sadness on a character by using a Tranquilizer, which can
also be used to cure you of Fury. Unlike every other Status in the game Fury
and Sadness are the only ailments that will not be removed from a character
once a battle has finished, and will carry over to each forthcoming battle
until the character/s have been cured.

It is also worth noting that a fair whack of the trophies that can be
obtained a related to the Limit Breaks. In fact, 18 of the 36 trophies (50%)
are Limit related; simply use each of the 9 character's first and last Limit
Break to gain half of the available trophies.


������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.02 B - Leveling Up Your Limits


  There are four Limit levels available for each character (excluding Cait
Sith & Vincent), levels 1, 2 & 3 contain two commands to select from in-
battle, and level 4 (being the ultimate level) only has one command to choose
from. To see what levels are currently available for a character, goto
'Limit' in the main menus. When a character's Limit Break levels up you must
manually set the Limit to the new level within this menu. This also enables
you to backtrack to previous levels; some Limit Breaks hold unique
properties, such as Aeris's Fury Brand and Barret's Mindblow.

There are two ways of Leveling up your Limit Breaks: 1) by getting x amount
of kills and 2) by using your Limits x amount of times. Here is a chart
depicting the required amount of kills and uses required to level up your
Limits:
              _________ _________ ___________ _________ ___________ _________
             |         |         |           |         |           |         |
             | Lv 1-1  | Lv 1-2  | Lv 2-1    | Lv 2-2  | Lv 3-1    | Lv 3-2  |
 +-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Cloud     | Default | 8 Uses  | 120 Kills | 7 Uses  | 320 Kills | 6 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Barret    | Default | 9 Uses  | 80 Kills  | 8 Uses  | 160 Kills | 6 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Tifa      | Default | 9 Uses  | 96  Kills | 7 Uses  | 192 Kills | 6 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Aeris     | Default | 8 Uses  | 80  Kills | 6 Uses  | 160 Kills | 5 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Red XIII  | Default | 8 Uses  | 72  Kills | 7 Uses  | 144 Kills | 6 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Yuffie    | Default | 8 Uses  | 64  Kills | 7 Uses  | 128 Kills | 6 Uses  |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Cait Sith | Default | N/A     | 40  Kills | N/A     | N/A       | N/A     |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Vincent   | Default | N/A     | 40  Kills | N/A     | 96  Kills | N/A     |
 |-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------|
 | Cid       | Default | 7 Uses  | 60  Kills | 6 Uses  | 136 Kills | 5 Uses  |
 +-----------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+

 NOTE - To unlock the 3-1 Limit Break you must acquire the above kill count as
        a total, not including the 2-1 kill count i.e. Cloud requires 320
        kills to unlock his 3-1, NOT 440.

So in order to unlock Limit 1-2 for Cloud, you must first use his 1-1 Limit 8
times. It is possible to unlock a character's 2-1 Limit before their 1-2
Limit by reaching the kill threshold prior to using the required amount of
Limits, however you manually 'Set' your Limit Breaks in the menus to level 2
otherwise you will be stuck with your level 1 Limit Break/s. You also *must*
unlock all 6 Limit Breaks in order to learn the ultimate level 4 Limit Break,
more on that to follow.

Whilst trying to level up your 1-2 / 2-2 / 3-2 Limit it is highly recommended
that you have your characters inflicted with Fury, aswell as keeping them in
the front row. Cover works really well too. Once they have achieved the next
level it is recommended that you remove the Fury Status as it can sometimes
make the battle system a little fragmented. Whilst working towards your 2-1 /
3-1 Limit just concentrate on magic spells that will attack every character
like Matra Magic, Trine or All=Lightning (for example).

There are other ways to help to level up your Limits. Aeris's 2-2 Fury Brand
for example will completely fill up the other two characters Limit gauge to
the maximum, meaning you can fly through to your X-2 Limits in no time. The
Manipulate Materia is another great way to help with filling you Limit
gauges. Seeing as a character's gauge will not fill up at all if you select
another player to hit that character, being able to manipulate a powerful
enemy (like the Valron) to hit that character instead is the best way to
quickly fill up you Limit gauge.

Thanks to GideonD's Limit Break Mechanic FAQ I now know that the following
applies:

 - Kills made using Odin's Steel Cutting Sword will *not* count towards your
   your kill total.
 - Kills made by poisoning an enemy will *not* count towards your kill total
   provided that the enemy died due to the Status effects of the Poison.
 - Kills made whilst initially casting Bio *will* count towards your kill
   total.
 - Kills made using an enemy that is manipulated will *not* count towards
   your kill total.
 - Kills made using Death Sentence will *not* count towards your kill total.
 - Kills made using the spell Death *will* count towards your kill total.
 - Kills made using Flash *will* count towards your kill total.
 - Kills and Limit Break uses gained in the Battle Arena will *not* count

 - Bizarrely enough, if you mimic a Limit Break then the character that used
   Mimic will be unable to perform the initial casters move, but it will
   still count towards the mimickers Limit Break 'uses'.

--E.02 C - Best Places to Limit Train

 1) Sector 4 Winding Tunnels

      After playing the game from the start for roughly an hour or so you
      will find yourself in the Winding Tunnels after having jumped off a
      moving train (unscathed). North will be your destination, however south
      will lead you to the only place in the game where you can encounter an
      infinite amount of enemies, continuously, uninterrupted. No need to run
      around in circles, you can simply select the option to fight the 3 x
      Special Combatants as many times as you wish, or you can run away to
      continue on with the mission.

      The main drawback here is that you cannot readily heal yourself, nor
      can you save the game in this area (once you continue on you will not
      be able to revisit the area). So basically, once you have run out of
      MP, Ethers and Potions you're screwed. Note that in the following area
      you will eventually find your first Tent of the game (next to the save
      point), so if you are desperate then you will have the chance to
      completely restore yourself. You'll also find an Ether as soon as you
      drop from the Winding Tunnels.

 2) Mythril Mine (North-Western Cave)

      After crossing the Midgar Zolom marsh on the back of a Chocobo you will
      come to the Mythril Mine. Head left one screen, then head into the
      northern cave. There are some fairly powerful foes here, such as the
      Ark Dragon whose Flamethrower attack will pack a punch. You can also
      encounter enemy formations in groups of 5, which is very useful indeed.
      Elemental=Choco/Mog in someone's weapon is the best way to deal with
      the Ark Dragon, All=Fire for the Castanets and All=Earth for the
      Crawlers. Don't forget to steal as many Grand Gloves as possible from
      the Madouge as they sell for 600 gil each.

 3) Junon Area Forests

      The 5 x Capparwire that you encounter here are awesome, as their Grand
      Spark move will deliver quite a lot of damage, making this area one of
      the best Limit training grounds on Disk 1 (in my opinion). The
      Formulas carry Boomerangs which can be sold for 700 gil each, and
      they can also hit all allies for medium damage with their Cross Impulse
      move.

 4) Mt. Corel Drawbridge Area

      This is the same area where you can steal the 10 x Phoenix Downs. Here
      you will encounter Search Crowns in formations of 5, you'll also find
      the Bagnadrana which can deliver a fair amount of damage with their
      Poison Breath. Both enemies are susceptible to L4 Suicide.

 5) Under Junon ('T' Intersection)

      After obtaining the buggy you can return to Junon by driving your buggy
      into Costa Del Sol, then bribing the man at the docks to let you
      stowaway in the cargo ship. Then head to the 'T' intersection in
      between upper and lower Junon and head south to come to a red panel
      near to where the troops are being drilled. Activate the panel to
      sound the alarm which will enable random encounters. Here you will
      engage with the strongest foes to date, the Death Machine and the
      Slalom.

      Although you'll only encounter enemies in groups of as much as 3, the
      Death Machine can deliver a punch with its W Machine Gun attack. Make
      sure to steal a few Smoke Bombs from the Slaloms aswell as they
      massively help out at the Battle Arena. I wouldn't recommend training
      here for too long though as they EXP gained here is way too high, and
      if you power level here too much then you'll just end up making the
      game way too easy.

 6) Mt. Nibel (Inner Caves)

      With enemy formations of 5 this is a great place to train, although the
      EXP gained is a little high. The Dragon's Flamethrower (Enemy Skill) is
      quite powerful, and the Kyuvilduns are weak against fire. Both enemies
      are susceptible to L4 Suicide.

 7) Nibel/Rocket Town Forests

      This is without a doubt the best Limit training ground in the whole
      game as the Battery Caps will come in groups of 6, which is the only
      place in the game where you can randomly encounter enemies with a 6 x
      formation. You can also manipulate the Valron to have it use its Dive
      Kick move which is Gravity based; it will always take out 25% of your
      max HP. It doesn't matter how far into the game you are, this should
      always be your first choice to train your Limits.

--E.02 D - Level 4 Limit Breaks


  Each character's level 4 Limit Break must be learned by first obtaining a
special item called a Limit Break Manual, you must then unlock all 6 previous
Limit Breaks for that character before they can learn their ultimate Limit
Breaks. Vincent has only 3 Limit Breaks to unlock before he can learn his
level 4 Limit as he does not have X-2 Limits to learn. Cait Sith does not
have a level 4 Limit Break; in fact Cait Sith only has two Limits in total to
choose from (Dice and Slots).

Once you have obtained the Limit Manual you will be able to find it within
the 'Item' menu. If you try to use the manual on either a character that
isn't ready to use it yet, or on the wrong character entirely then you will
hear an error sound followed by a negative quote from that character, but if
he/she is ready to learn it then you will get a positive quote and a
'success' sound. The level 4 Limit will then be available to select in the
'Limit' menu.

Here is how to obtain each characters Level 4 Limit Manual:

 Cloud - {Omnislash}  ("OK, I got it!")
                      ("I'm not too sure but...")
                      ("Don't really care.")

         Obtained in the Battle Arena at the Gold Saucer. This prize is first
         available in Disk 1 after you have obtained the Tiny Bronco and will
         cost a whopping 51,200 BP, so you'd better refine your Super Dunk
         skills if you want it that early on. Alternatively, come back once
         you've obtained the Highwind to see the price reduced to 32,000 BP.


 Barret - {Catastrophe}  ("Heh! No sweat!")
                         ("D-d-d-damn! My head hurts!")
                         ("Got nuthin' to do with me!")

         Obtained after the Huge Materia quest in Mt. Corel on Disk 2. After
         you have saved North Corel (or not) you can talk to the woman in the
         house on the second floor to receive Barret's Catastrophe.


 Tifa - {Final Heaven}  ("Hmm, so that's it.")
                        ("I'm not too sure, but...")
                        ("I've got the wrong person.")

         Obtained on Disk 2 after you have Cloud back from Mideel. Head over
         to Nibelheim to play on Tifa's piano, then play the notes:

         X, Sq, Tr, L1+Tr, L1+Sq, X, Sq, Tr, L1+X, O, X, Sq, X

         You will then receive a note from Tifa's mentor, along with her Level
         4 Limit Manual, Final Heaven.


 Aeris - {Great Gospel}  ("This should be okay.")
                         ("Not quite ready yet.")
                         ("It isn't me.")

         Obtained on Disk 1 by firstly obtaining the Mythril which can then
         be traded for the Great Gospel. Once you have escaped from the Corel
         Prison on Disk 1 you will have the buggy, you can then return to
         Junon by driving the buggy directly into Costa Del Sol, then
         speaking to one of the sailors on the docks to travel back to
         Junon. When you leave Junon you will be in your buggy, head towards
         the larger forest and you'll find part of the river that can be
         crossed, head over it and then travel north to find a secret cave.

         Inside the cave you will find a sleeping man who will disclose to
         you one of your battle stats. If he tells you a stat other than your
         battle count then leave the cave and re-enter until he tells you how
         many times you have fought. If the last two digits are identical
         (i.e. 111, 255, 477 etc.) then he will give you one of two prizes.
         If both digits are even then you will receive a Bolt Ring, if they
         are odd however then you shall receive the Mythril.

         You won't be able to do anything with the Mythril until you have
         obtained the Tiny Bronco, you can then visit the lone house south of
         Gongaga to talk to the weapon seller. He will happily exchange the
         contents of one of his boxes for the Mythril, the larger of the two
         boxes contains a measly Gold Armlet (which can be bought from Rocket
         Town for 2000 gil), however the smaller of the two chests on the 2nd
         floor holds Aeris's Level 4 Limit Manual, the Great Gospel.

 Red XIII - {Cosmo Memory}  ("Right, I've got it!")
                            ("I don't get it.")
                            ("It has nothing to do with me".)

         Obtained on Disk 1 after defeating Lost Number in the Shinra Mansion
         in Nibelheim. Cosmo Memory is the first Level 4 Limit Manual
         available in the game, followed by Aeris's Great Gospel. In the
         western wing of the 2nd floor of the Shinra Mansion you will find a
         safe, enter the following combination:

         Right 36, Left 10, Right 59, Right 97

         You must not go past the correct digit or you will fail the sequence
         and have to start over. Once the correct code has been entered you
         will have to fight a boss, Lost Number who will drop Cosmo Memory.

 Yuffie - {All Creation}  ("Cool! This should do it!")
                          ("Nope! I don't get it!")
                          ("Oh wow, I'm totally clueless!")

         Obtained after completing Yuffie's optional sidequest in Wutai on
         Disk 1. Once you have regained all of your Materia, equip Yuffie
         with your best load out and head over to the large pagoda. Here you
         can face 5 bosses. After defeating Godo, the final boss, you will
         receive Yuffie's All Creation.

 Cait Sith - N/A  ("It's got nothing to do with me.")

             Cait Sith does not have a level 4 Limit.

 Vincent - {Chaos}  ("I'm becoming less human...")
                    ("I'm still not ready.")
                    ("It has nothing to do with me.")

         Obtained on Disk 2 after gaining Cloud back from Mideel. You will
         need to then obtain a Chocobo that can climb mountains, or continue
         on with the story until you have obtained the submarine. Directly
         south of North Corel you fill find a closed off Lagoon, head to it
         on your Chocobo to find Lucrecia's Cave. Alternatively you can dive
         in you submarine and head north until you reach an underwater
         ravine, then take a sharp left to come to a long underwater tunnel
         which will lead to the aforementioned Lagoon.

         Make sure that Vincent is in you party before entering the cave.
         When you enter you will learn a bit about Vincent and his past. Then
         head out of the cave and complete 10 random battles which cannot be
         done in the grassy area outside of the cave as no enemies lurk
         there. Once you're ready, head back into the cave to find that
         Lucrecia has left Vincent's ultimate weapon, Death Penalty along
         with his Level 4 Limit Manual, Chaos.

 Cid - {Highwind}  ("Hey I like this! Lemme use it!")
                   ("Hmph, don't quite get it but...")
                   ("Not me! Give it to someone else!")

         Obtained on Disk 2 once you have obtained the submarine. Head over to
         the submarine dock near the Gold Saucer then submerge to find the
         Sunken Gelnika. Be wary as sometimes Emerald Weapon is sitting
         right in front of the crashed plane. You will find the Level 4 Limit
         Manual in a chest in the Cargo Room.

] Tifa's Limit Breaks are fairly unique in the sense that they will 'stack'. [
] When a new Limit is learned Tifa will still hit with all of her previous   [
] Limits she has learned to date, including the new one learnt. When using   [
] her Limit Break in-battle a fruit machine style slot game will initiate.   [
] Stopping one of the reels on 'hit' will mean she will use that Limit for   [
] normal damage, landing on 'miss' means that she will not use that Limit    [
] at all and landing on 'yeah' will result in double damage for that Limit.  [
] The later Limits will have 'yeah's' that are surrounded by 'miss's'.       [
]                                                                            [
] It's worth noting that you'll need to have her Limit Break set to the      [
] level that you wish to learn for her Limit uses to count. Let's say you    [
] had acquired 96 kills before using Beat Rush 9 times and you had then set  [
] her Limit to level 2. The game would then stop counting the times that you [
] used Beat Rush and you would not be able to unlock Somersault until you    [
] had set her Limit to level 1 again. Also, if you land on a 'miss' then the [
] game would not regard that as a use of that Limit and would not add one to [
] the Limit Break count.                                                     [

] the ability to fill your other two players Limit's gauge up to the max is  [
] incredibly useful. Also, Aeris's Lv 4 Limit is available very early on in  [
] the game. In fact, there's only three other character's that can get their [
] Lv 4 Limit on the go as early as Disk 1! Planet Protector and Great Gospel [

] Red XIII's Limit's are mainly offensive with the exception of Lunatic High [
] and Howling Moon. The fact that Red XIII's Level 4 Limit Manual is         [
] obtainable before any other characters is the reason I like to have him on [
] my team early-on alongside Aries. Given the strength of Cosmo Memory you   [
] should be able to hit with 9999 damage whilst still being a relatively low [
] level. Once Red XIII starts to level up however I would recommend using    [
] Earth Rave or even Stardust Ray seeing as the damage inflicted will        [
] surpass Cosmo Memory's, not to mention the fact that the Limit gauge is    [
] easier to fill at lower levels. Lunatic High is also great as it gives you [
] the ability to cast Haste early on in the game.                            [

] With the exception of Clear Tranquil all of Yuffie's Limit Breaks are      [
] offensive. As with Red XIII, Yuffie's level 4 Limit will hit for           [
] tremendous damage and can be obtained relatively early on in the game      [
] (after you have obtained the Tiny Bronco). As Yuffie levels up along with  [
] her Attack power, I suggest reverting back to her 3-2 Doom of the Living   [
] as it will deliver more overall damage whilst requiring less HP damage for [
] the Limit gauge to fill.                                                   [

] Note that in order to obtain All Creation you must first beat the boss     [
] Godo, and if you were to do so before obtaining the Enemy Skill Trine then [
] you may have jeopardised your chance to obtain the Materia Overlord        [
] Achievement as Godo is one of three enemies that will use Trine. For what  [
] it's worth, I suggest waiting until you have obtained the Highwind before  [
] defeating Godo for the All Creation Limit Break Manual as so that you can  [
] obtain Trine for all four Enemy Skill Materias. See section G.02 for more  [
] info.                                                                      [

] Vincent, like Cait Sith has an unusual Limit Break system in more ways     [
] than one. Firstly there is no X-2 to Vincent's Limit's, and secondly the   [
] Limit's he uses can be very unpredictable. Similar to the Status Berserk,  [
] you will lose control of Vincent for the remainder of the battle whilst he [
] transforms himself into a beast that is capable of performing deadly       [
] attacks on your enemies. The biggest hindrance being that some of these    [
] moves have Elemental properties, and you could find yourself healing your  [
] foes instead of harming them. The two moves that have Elemental properties [
] are 1-1 Beast Flare which uses Fire and 2-1 Live Wire which uses           [
] Lightning.                                                                 [

] When Vincent transforms his HP will be restored, however if Vincent were   [
] to be killed during the battle then he would resort back to his former     [
] self. Whilst transformed, you will not be able to choose which attack      [
] Vincent uses; he will have a 70% chance of using is primary attack and a   [
] 30% chance of using his secondary attack. He will also be immune to        [
] Berserk, Confusion and Frog.                                               [

 | Cait Sith starts off with 2 dice and every 10 levels he gains he         |
 | receives an extra die with a maximum of six. He will gain an extra dice  |
 | at level 30, 40, 50 & 60.                                                |
 |                                                                          |
 | The sum of the dice multiplied by the quantity of 'repeat' numbers       |
 | multiplied by 100 will be the resulting damage total to a single enemy.  |
 | So, if you were to roll 1,2,2,2,4,6 then the resulting damage would be   |
 | 17 x 3 x 100 = 5100 HP. 17 is the sum of the die and 3 is the amount of  |
 | times the number two landed, hence 17 x 3 x 100.                         |
 |                                                                          |
 |  2 dice damage range -  300 to 2400. Average -  817 HP                   |
 |  3 dice damage range -  600 to 5400. Average - 1546 HP                   |
 |  4 dice damage range - 1000 to 9600. Average - 2554 HP                   |
 |  5 dice damage range - 1500 to 9999. Average - 3743 HP                   |
 |  6 dice damage range - 2100 to 9999. Average - 5026 HP                   |

 | Similar to Tifa's Limit only this time it's even more like a fruit       |
 | machine in the sense that you are aiming to match 3 slots together in a  |
 | row. If all 3 slots are different then Cait Sith will use Toy Box which  |
 | will cast one of 7 different basic attacks:                              |
 |                                                                          |

 | Should all three symbols match however then Cait Sith will use one of    |
 | his special attacks:                                                     |
 |                                                                          |

 |             A random Summon will be used costing 0 MP. The higher the    |
 |             level of Cait Sith, the higher the chance will be of getting |
 |             a better summon.                                             |

 |             Cait Sith morphs with the other two characters to become one |
 |             big giant! His new stats are the combined stats of all three |
 |             players, without exceeding 9999HP, 999MP or 255 strength etc.|
 |                                                                          |

 |               ends or the character dies.                                |
 |                                                                          |

 |                   are attacking from the same side. Overrides Death      |
 |                   immunity, making Game Over very useful indeed.         |

 |   2 x CAIT SITH, 1 x BAR - Death Joker:                                  |
 |                            All allies are instantly killed provided that |

] Cait Sith is the only Character in the game that doesn't have a Level 4    [
] Limit Break. In fact, seeing as he has a move that can end the game        [
] instantly, I'd say that Cait Sith is probably one of the more obsolete     [
] characters in the game, although if you know how to use him correctly Cait [
] Sith could be regarded as an asset to your squad. Requiring only 60% to    [
] fill his level 2 Limit (which is the least of all characters Lv 2 Limits), [
] Cait Sith's Slots offers a variety of 'random' goodies with the exception  [
] of the Death Joker (save often if your using Cait Sith). Here's how to     [
] manipulate the reels to land on the sequence your choice:                  [
]                                                                            [
]  The first trick to mention is the Square trick. By pressing square you    [
]  will stop the reels completely, and by repeatedly pressing square you can [
]  slow the reels right down which will make it easier to memorise the       [
]  pattern. This trick can also be used whilst in the Battle Arena when      [
]  trying to land on a specific handicap, and can also be applied when using [
]  Tifa's Limit Breaks.                                                      [
]                                                                            [
]  The main problem is the so called 'Evil Flag'. When the Evil Flag is      [
]  turned off then the second and third reel will automatically align        [
]  themselves to match the first symbol you landed on, provided that you     [
]  stopped the 2nd and 3rd reels within 5 symbols of the matching symbol.    [
]  When the Evil Flag is activated however, the 2nd and 3rd reel will stop   [
]  in the exact place that you selected it to, making it very difficult to   [
]  match up three symbols. To make it harder still, if you did manage to     [
]  align the first two symbols then the third reel will jump one place after [
]  the one you selected.                                                     [
]                                                                            [
]  The Evil Flag's status is determined firstly by which symbol you have     [
]  landed on, and secondly by the internal game clock:                       [
]                                                                            [
]  - Crown     - Evil Flag is off                                            [
]  - Star      - Evil Flag is off                                            [
]  - BAR       - Evil Flag is off if Game Time is divisible by 2 (50%)       [
]  - Mog       - Evil Flag is off if Game Time is divisible by 2 (50%)       [
]  - Heart     - Evil Flag is off if Game Time is divisible by 4 (25%)       [
]  - Cait Sith - Evil Flag is off if Game Time is divisible by 64 (1.5625%)  [
]                                                                            [
]  Now to learn the reels themselves. Each reel has 16 symbols in the        [
]  following order:                                                          [
]                                                                            [

] That almost concludes my Cait Sith Limit Break 'slots' tutorial. Although  [
] the above info should make it easier for you to get the desired sequence,  [
] it can still be fairly tricky and requires an amount of practise and       [
] patience before you have mastered Cait Sith's slots. Regard it as training [
] for the slots in the Battle Arena in the Gold Sauce seeing as the          [
] mechanics work the same in regards to tapping square to slow the reels     [
] down, and landing on the correct handicap will result in large amounts of  [
] BP, although it's MUCH easier to manipulate the reels there as you'll only [
] have 3 icons per slot.                                                     [

] One last thing to mention, here are the chances of Cait Sith summoning     [
] which Summon, depending on his level. Note that the text display at top of [
] the screen will display the Summon's name, as opposed the actual attack    [
] name, with the exception of Fat Chocobo, and Grunge Lance.                 [

  The Turtle Paradise Mini-Game is basically a quest to find 6 posters dotted
around the world (well, technically there are 7 posters). Once you have found
all 7 you can enter the Turtle Paradise located on the western side of Wutai
to talk to the bar tender to claim your prizes:

Power Source, Guard Source, Magic Source, Mind Source, Speed Source, Luck
Source and a Megalixir

 NOTE - You will not be able to enter Wutai until you have obtained the Tiny
        Bronco around 3/4 into Disk 1.

Here are the locations of all posters found around Gaia:

    Found in Midgar in Sector 5 just after you meet Aeris properly. Search
    the top floor of the south-eastern house in the markets. At the top of
    the stairs of the boys room you will find {Turtle Paradise Poster #1}.

    If you missed it the first time then you will get another chance when you
    revisit the area a little later on with Barret and Tifa. If you missed it
    that time round then you will have to return once you have obtained the
    Key to Sector 5 on Disk 2, see section E.20 for info on how to obtain it.

    **THIS POSTER IS PERMANENTLY MISSABLE**
    The first opportunity you will
    get to read this will be during your first raid on the Shinra HQ early on
    Disk 1. On the first floor on the north-east corner you will find a huge
    bulletin board. Search it thoroughly to find {Turtle Paradise Poster #2}.

    If you missed it the first time round then you will have to wait until
    you are near to the end of Disk 2 when you raid the Shinra HQ for a
    second time. If you miss it here then you will have failed this side quest
    forever.

  During section D1.04 B - Wall Market you will have to dress Cloud up as a
woman in order to proceed with the game, and you can vary the selection of
attire he wears. Depending on your selection, either Cloud, Tifa or Aeris
will be chosen to be Don Corneo's 'date' for the evening.

The minimum requirement to enter Don Corneo's mansion is just a dress and a
wig, however you could if you wished enter the mansion with a dress, wig,
cologne, tiara, underwear and make-up. Each choice you make will have an
effect on the scoring system, and your final score will affect the outcome:

  2 - 11: Tifa  will be chosen as Don's date
 12 - 18: Aeris will be chosen as Don's date
 19 - 25: Cloud will be chosen as Don's date

Having Cloud chosen will unlock PS4 users the Consummate Cross-dresser Trophy.

Here is how the scoring system works:

 {DRESS}

+5 - Silk Dress   (Soft, Shimmers)
+3 - Satin Dress  (Soft, Shiny)
+1 - Cotton Dress (Clean)

 {WIG}

+5 - Blonde Wig (Beat Big Bro)
+3 - Dyed Wig   (Draw with Big Bro)
+1 - Wig        (Lose to Big Bro)

 {COLOGNE}

+5 - Sexy Cologne   (Digestive)
+3 - Flower Cologne (Deodorant)
+1 - Cologne        (Disinfectant)

 {TIARA}

+5 - Diamond Tiara (200 gil)
+3 - Ruby Tiara    (100 gil)
+1 - Glass Tiara   (50 gil)

 {UNDERWEAR}

+0 - Bikini Briefs (Group Room)
+0 - Lingerie      (&$#% Room)

 Note - The Bikini Briefs were supposed to grant you +5, the Mystery Panties
        was supposed to grant you +3 and the Lingerie was supposed to grant
        you +1 but for unknown reasons the scoring system along with the
        Mystery Panties was phased out of the final game.

 {MAKE-UP}

+5 - 25% chance (Wind sound, difficult to hear)
+3 - 38% chance (Healing sound)
+1 - 38% chance ('Tink' sound)

--E.05 A - About Elements


  Elements are a recurring theme for the Final Fantasy series. The most
notorious of these are Fire, Ice and Lightning, and many enemies will have
Elemental attributes that will affect the way the battle system plays out.

The 8 variables are (in order of priority):

Auto-Hit - The target cannot evade the attack.
Death    - The target is instantly killed.
Recovery - The target is completely recovered.
Nullify  - The damage dealt will be 0.
Absorb   - The damage dealt will be absorbed.
Halve    - The damage dealt will be halved
Double   - The damage dealt will be doubled.

There are nine basic Elements in Final Fantasy VII and a number of obscure
Elements that will be detailed further on. In the order that they are
obtainable these 9 Elements are:

Lightning   Ice   Fire   Poison   Earth   Wind   Water   Gravity   Holy
LHT         ICE   FRE    PSN      ERT     WND    WTR     GRV       HLY

All of the Elemental attributes of all enemies are listed area-by-area
throughout the walkthrough using the abbreviations as shown above. You should
always try to use Elements that an enemy is weak against whilst veering away
from Elements that an enemy is strong against. Remember that by using the
Elemental Materia you can protect yourself from Elemental attacks by
equipping it to your armour, and you can also add an Element onto your basic
physical attacks by equipping it to your weapon. More on the Elemental
Materia below.

It's important to note that Poison is also a Status, however an enemy's
Elemental strength/weakness to poison will not correlate to the enemies
immunity/vulnerability to the poison Status, although a mastered Elemental
Materia placed in your armour paired with Poison *will* protect you from both
the Element and the Status Poison.

A few other things to point out - nearly all Bosses are immune to Gravity,
with the exception of the Midgar Zolom, Godo and Emerald Weapon. Similarly,
virtually all flying creatures are weak against Wind but will nullify Earth
based attacks. Also, Vincent's Level 1 Limit Break, Galian Beast, has an
attack called Beast Flare that will hit with Fire damage, and his Level 2
Limit Death Gigas has an attack called Live Wire that will hit with Lightning
damage. Yuffie's 2-1 Limit Break is Earth based.

Lastly, there are more Elements in play than the basic 9 as listed above, the
most notable being the Restorative Element (RES). See the Obscure Elements
below for more details.

                                                                   {Elemental}

--E.05 B - Elemental Materia


  The Elemental Materia is easily one of the most under-rated Materias in the
game and is easily missed during the assault on the Shinra HQ early on in the
game. There are 3 in total to collect:

1) D1.06 A - Fight or Flight of Stairs

   Floor 62. Whilst speaking to the Mayor you can obtain the Elemental
   Materia by guessing his password on the first try; the password is
   different from game to game. The  most simple way to do this would be to
   save just before talking to him, then guessing until you get the correct
   password. Finally, reload your save then talk to the Mayor selecting the
   correct password on the first try for the Elemental Materia.

2) D1.15 C - Mt. Nibel

   During your travels you will eventually come to the same place where Cloud
   and Sephiroth and co. stopped to admire a Lifestream fountain. Five years
   later the energy from the fountain will have formed into the Elemental
   Materia.

3) D1.07 B - The Nibelheim Incident

   During the flashback from 5 years ago you must enter into Tifa's house and
   interact with her piano in the second floor. Make sure to 'jam on it'
   otherwise you won't be able to retrieve the 3rd and final Elemental
   Materia.

   D2.05 D - Playing Tifa's Piano in Nibelheim

   You can only do this whilst playing as Tifa on Disk 2 just after you've
   received the Highwind. Interact with her piano once more to receive the
   Elemental Materia so long as you followed the prerequisite as above.

Pairing the Elemental Materia to another piece of Materia that has an
Elemental attribute will either protect you from the Element, or make your
physical attacks hit with that Element, depending on whether you have
equipped the Materias onto you armour or weapon, respectively.

When you place the Elemental Materia in your weapon, the level of the
Elemental will not vary the effect of the attack, however when placed in your
armour the current level of the Elemental will vary the effect. At level 1
you will take halve the damage of the Element that it is paired with, at
level 2 you will nullify the damage and at level 3 you will absorb the
damage. If you were to pair a level 3 Elemental with Lightning in your
armour, then you could use Lightning based attacks to heal yourself! Remember
that your Spirit and Magic stat will affect the amount HP you are healed by.

Remember that you can view your current Elemental strengths in the 'Status'
menu; press confirm to scroll through the three tabs.

 NOTE - Pairing Fire with the Elemental on your armour is the only way to
        obtain the Enemy Skill Beta from the Midgar Zolom at a low level
        (along with the Status Sadness).

Remember that some Summons also have Elemental properties. Below is a list of
every 'pairable' Materia:

    ELEMENT:   |  MAGIC:     |  SUMMON:
               |             |
    Lightning  |  Lightning  |  Ramuh
    Ice        |  Ice        |  Shiva
    Fire       |  Fire       |  Ifrit, Phoenix
    Poison     |  Poison     |  --------
    Earth      |  Earth      |  Titan
    Wind       |  ---------  |  Choco/Mog, Typoon
    Water      |  ---------  |  Leviathan
    Gravity    |  Gravity    |  ---------
    Holy       |  ---------  |  Alexander

 - It is recommended that you equip the Elemental Materia with Lightning as
   soon as you obtain it seeing as many enemies in the Shinra HQ are weak
   against lightning.
 - Once you receive the Choco/Mog Materia in the Chocobo ranch you can switch
   to Wind based attacks seeing as a large amount of enemies from that point
   on are 'flying', meaning they will beak weak vs Wind but strong vs Earth.
 - The Great Glacier on Disk 2 is home to many creatures that are weak
   against Fire.

Remember that it is always advisable to pair a Summon as opposed to Magic
with your Elemental Materia seeing as you are not penalised as much.

Lightning will have the following effect on your stats:
Strength -1, Magic +1, Max HP -2%, Max MP +2%.
Ramuh will *not* affect your strength but will affect your Magic, Max HP and
Max MP by the same values.

Below is a chart depicting the quantity of enemies that are weak and strong
against each Element:

            +----------------------------------+ +--------+
            | Absorb | Nullify | Halve | Total | | Double |
+-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Fire      |     12 |       4 |    12 |    28 | |     15 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Ice       |     11 |       5 |     5 |    21 | |      8 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Lightning |      7 |       5 |     3 |    15 | |     28 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Earth     |      4 |      52 |     3 |    59 | |      4 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Poison    |     17 |       6 |     0 |    23 | |      2 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Gravity   |      0 |      70 |    12 |    82 | |      5 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Water     |      5 |      18 |     5 |    28 | |      4 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Wind      |      0 |       1 |     0 |     1 | |     29 |
|-----------+--------+---------+-------+-------| |--------|
| Holy      |      0 |       1 |     0 |     1 | |     10 |
+----------------------------------------------+ +--------+

So you can see that Wind, Lightning and Holy are the favourable Elements to
equip with the Elemental onto your weapon, whilst Earth, Gravity, Water and
Fire should be avoided, with the exception of certain areas (like the Great
Glacier).

--E.05 C - Obscure Elements


  There are 7 Elements that go relatively unknown, these are:

RESTORATIVE    CUT    HIT    PUNCH    SHOOT    SHOUT    HIDDEN

It is suspected that the developers had initially intended for every single
physical attack to use the Element Cut, Hit, Punch, Shoot or Shout, and
certain enemies would have varying strengths/weaknesses to these 'Physical'
Elements. Even though they had decided in the end that it was too
complicated, there are still a few enemies that are weak against certain
Elements (like the Desert Sahagin which is weak against Punch). Nearly all of
the characters weapons will conform to one of these Elements and a vast
majority of enemies will use attacks with one of these properties, however
Restorative and Hidden work slightly differently.

 NOTE - The Ziedrich is a piece of armour that will halve all Elemental
        attacks, and this includes any of the above Elements excluding
        Restorative and Hidden. The Ziedrich is considered to be one of the
        best defensive armour in the game, the drawback being that it doesn't
        have any Materia slots.

{Restorative}:

 If an enemy is weak against the Element Holy then there is a strong chance
 that the enemy will also absorb the Restorative Element, which means that
 curative items and spells will harm the enemy as opposed to healing it (the
 double positive makes a negative). Enemies that conform to this would be
 considered 'Undead', and this is a familiar trait with the Final Fantasy
 series.

 Of all 10 enemies that are weak against Holy, only two of them do *not*
 absorb the Restorative Element, and these two are Soul Fire and Parasite.
 It's worth noting that pairing Elemental with Restore will have no effect
 whatsoever. Also, using items such as Ethers and Turbo Ethers will deplete
 your opponents MP, and casting a Megalixir/Elixir/X-Potion or Phoenix Down
 will cause instant Death to your opponent. Regen is *not* of the restorative
 Element and therefore it won't act to gradually deplete your opponents HP.

 More on Restorative below.

{Cut}:

 The Cut Element is primarily attributed to attacks that 'slice' such as
 swords, namely all of Cloud's weapons, one of Barret's and one of Cid's.
 There are 36 enemy attacks that use the Cut Element.

{Hit}:

 Hit is one of the most used Physical attacks in the game, and is primarily
 attributed to attacks that use blunt force such as clubs or batons. Most of
 Tifa's weapons, some of Barret's, all of Aeris's, most of Red XIII, all of
 Cait Sith's and one of Cid's use the Hit Element. There are 103 enemy
 attacks that use the Hit Element.

{Punch}:

 Surprisingly enough, Tifa's attacks do not conform to the Punch Element.
 Thrust would have been a more appropriate title seeing as attacks that
 penetrate fall under the Punch Element, such as daggers and spears. 3 of
 Barret's weapons, two of Tifa's and most of Cid's fall under the Punch
 category. 31 enemy attacks use the Punch Element.

 Some enemies will be weak against Punch, such as the Desert Sahagin found
 near Cosmo Canyon. When you attack it with one of Cid's weapons, you will
 not do double damage, rather, you will have a 100% attack rate instead. The
 same applies to the Sahagin and the Ceasar found in Sector 6 Sewers. Thanks
 to NFITC1 for clarifying some of that up.

{Shoot}:

 All attacks that are made from a distance are considered to be of the
 Element Shoot, such as guns or shurikens. Most of Barret's weapons, one of
 Red XIII's, all of Yuffie's and all of Vincent's are considered to be of the
 Element Shoot. 82 enemy attacks fall under the Shoot Element.

{Shout}:

 Attacks that are made through sound are considered to be Shout, and weirdly
 enough that doesn't mean Cait Sith (probably because Cait's in-battle
 animation is to hit his target as opposed to shout at it). No allies use
 Shout and only 12 enemy attacks fall under the Shout Element.

{Hidden}:

 Interestingly enough, Hidden isn't actually called Hidden, it just the title
 that has been dubbed for this Element seeing as it doesn't actually have a
 name. It is also sometimes referred to as 'The 10th Element'. Obviously this
 Element was intended to be removed from the final cut of the game, but like
 many other 'elements' (or fragments) of the game this was slightly hurried
 and was probably left in the game due to time pressure.

 To protect yourself from Hidden you would need to pair Elemental with any
 *non* Elemental Materia, with the exception of Restore and any Support
 (blue) Materia. So, if you were to link Elemental=Luck Plus (for example) on
 your armour then you would then be protected from any attacks that use the
 Hidden Element. Seeing as there are no enemies that are weak against Hidden,
 linking Elemental=(Hidden) to your weapon would be pointless.

 In the Japanese original version of the game there were 15 direct attacks
 that used the Hidden Element, but in the later SCEA/SCEE (or NTSC/PAL)
 versions all but one of these moves had the Hidden Element removed from
 their attacks. The attack that was left in the game was Ultimate WEAPON's
 'Ultima Beam', and you can still absorb/nullify/halve the effects of this
 attack by protecting yourself from Hidden. There are also a number of
 passive attacks that use Hidden such as Status changes and Status
 protection, however you cannot defend yourself from a 'Hidden' attack if no
 damage is being directly dealt.

--E.05 D - The Elements Themselves


  Below you will find a complete run-down of every appearance of each
Element, from equippable Materia to battle items to enemy attributes. It is
important to note that several attacks/Summons will yield more than one
Elemental property, which isn't always a good thing due to the fact that if
an enemy can absorb one of the Elements then the entire attack will be
absorbed (or nullifies, or halved).

Magic Breath - Enemy Skill. Hits with Lightning, Ice & Fire
Kjata        - Summon.      Hits with Lightning, Ice & Fire
Typoon       - Summon.      Hits with Lightning, Ice, Fire & Earth

It is also important to note that while Choco/Mog may be a Wind based
Materia, when you cast Choco/Mog in battle neither of its attacks will be
Wind based. You will only be able to utilise the Wind Element when pairing
Choco/Mog with the Elemental Materia. The same goes for Typoon, even though
it is classed as a Wind Based Materia, when used in-battle it will not attack
with Wind.

Lastly, due to the complexity of Bizarro�Sephiroth's varying forms I haven't
included any of his Elemental strengths/weaknesses in the following data,
however I have included his Elemental attacks.

+---------------------+
|   {FIRE}:    FRE    |
+---------------------+

There are 15 enemies that are weak against Fire and 28 enemies that are
strong against Fire. The best time to equip Fire would be in the Great
Glacier early on in Disk 2. Vincent's Level 1 Limit Break, Galian Beast uses
a move called Beast Flare which is Fire based. Ifrit is the only Fire based
Summon in the game and uses an attack called Hellfire.

Fire is first available from the Materia Shop in Sector 7, but will also be
obtained via Red XIII's initial equipment whilst raiding the Shinra HQ.
Notable Fire based enemies include Motor Ball, Ark Dragon, Bomb, Soul Fire,
Dragon, Foulander and Grenade.

+--------------------+

There are 8 enemies that are weak against Ice and 21 enemies that are strong
against Ice. The majority of Fire based creatures are vulnerable to Ice,
which unfortunately are few and far between. Shiva is the only Ice Summon in
the game and can damage all foes with her Diamond Dust move.

Ice is initially equipped on Cloud at the beginning of the game, and is
available from most Materia Shops in Midgar. Notable Ice based enemies
include Boundfat, Snow, Ice Golem, Lessaloploth and Icicle.

|    POISON :    PSN    |                                     {Poison Element}
+-----------------------+

There are 2 enemies that are weak against Poison and 23 enemies that are
strong against Poison. Whilst the Poison Element and the Poison Status are
completely separate, there are instances where the two are linked. For
example, a mastered Elemental paired with Poison in ones armour will also
defend against the Status Poison. Similarly, if you were to pair the Added
Effect Materia with Poison you would also nullify the Elemental damage.

Poison is first available from a chest in Hojo's Laboratory in the Shinra HQ
and can then be bought from Kalm. Notable Poison based creatures include
Brain Pod, Zenene, Flower Prong, Slalom and Malboro.

|  NOTE - There are more attacks that are Poison based than is shown above,  |
|         however I have only listed the moves that attack with the          |
|         Poison Element (and therefore damages). A full list of Poison      |
|         based Status changing attacks can be found in section E.09.        |

|   {GRAVITY}:    GRV    |
+------------------------+

There are 5 enemies that are weak against Gravity and a whopping 82 enemies
that are strong against Gravity. Seeing as the majority of Bosses are immune
to Gravity based attacks (46 to be precise) Demi should be avoided, unless of
course you're in a regular battle; in which case Gravity can be quite useful.
The nature of Gravity is that it doesn't deal direct damage, instead it deals
damage that is proportionate to ones max HP, meaning a tough enemy can be
made not so tough using the right Gravity based attack (such as Laser, which
is identical to Demi2).

Demi will drain 1/4 of your opponents max HP, Demi2 & Laser will drain 1/2 of
your opponents Max HP and Demi3 will drain 3/4 of your opponents max HP,
without breaking the 9999 cap. Emerald WEAPON is one of the few Bosses to
Halve Gravity as opposed to completely nullifying it, meaning you can still
use Gravity to inflict 9999 each hit. Pairing Gravity with the Elemental
Materia on your weapon will only make your physical attacks deal double
damage against enemies weak to Gravity, your attacks won't become completely
Gravity based if that makes sense; you won't start attacking for damage
proportionate to your targets Max HP.

You can first obtain a Gravity based attack when you reach Corel Prison by
learning Laser from Death Claw, you can then obtain the Gravity Materia when
you reach the Cave of The Gi. Notable Gravity based creatures include Valron.
That's it, just Valron.

|   {WIND}:    WND    |
+---------------------+

There are 29 enemies that are weak against Wind and 1 enemy that is strong
against Wind, making Wind probably the best Element to have in the game. All
flying creatures are weak against Wind, whilst at the same time being strong
against Earth. Although Choco/Mog's in-battle attacks are non-elemental, you
will still be able to pair it with the Elemental Materia for Wind based
attacks/defence. The same applies for Typoon.

You can first obtain a Wind based Materia (Choco/Mog) at the Chocobo Ranch.
It is recommended that you equip it straight away as a lot of enemies from
that point onwards will be weak against Wind. Notable Wind based creatures
include Formula, Zuu & Tonadu (although all will be weak vs Wind).

|   {HOLY}:    HLY    |
+---------------------+

There are 10 enemies that are weak against Holy and 1 enemy that is strong
against Holy. Enemies that are weak against Holy are usually regarded as
Undead, but not always. Annoyingly enough, by the time you obtain the only
Holy based Materia in the game you'll have already encountered the majority
of enemies that are weak to Holy. The Materia in question is Alexander, and
can rain damage with his attack 'Judgement'.

The important thing to note is to not confuse Holy with the Restorative
Element. *Most* enemies that are weak against Holy will also absorb the
Restorative Element, meaning that Potions and other healing moves will harm
your enemy. Most, but not all. The Parasite for example (North Crater) and
the Soul Fire (Cave of The Gi) will take double damage should you pair
Alexander with Elemental on your weapon, while Curative items and spells will
just heal them normally.

It's also worth pointing out that not a single enemy contains an attack that
is Holy based, so the Holy Nullifying effect of the Minerva Band is
effectively pointless. You can first obtain the only Holy based Summon,
Alexander whilst traversing through the Great Glacier on Disk 2. There are no
Holy based creatures in the game.

|   {RESTORATIVE}:    RES    |
+----------------------------+

There are 8 enemies in the game that can absorb the Restorative Element, and
as such can be harmed by healing moves and items. These enemies are generally
considered to be 'Undead' creatures. Notable Undead creatures include Ghost,
Gi Nattak and Dragon Zombie.

Note that casting White Wind on Undead creatures will deal damage equal to
the casters current HP, whilst at the same time causing Petrify.

--E.06 A - Fort Condor Itself


  Fort condor is basically a Shinra Reactor with a giant Condor 'nesting' its
egg upon the top of it! FC can be found in Junon Area and can fist be visited
just after exiting the Mythril Mines. Although FC is a completely optional
mini-quest, you will have to visit FC as part of the story line mid-way
through Disk 2. FC also serves as a brilliant resting spot whilst attempting
to recruit Yuffie (see section E.07), or whilst training in the Forests near
Junon which serve as an excellent training spot when you first arrive in this
area.

When you first enter Fort Condor you will have some dialogue that will affect
certain players 'rating' towards you (see section E.01). You will be asked if
you're willing to assist a small rebel faction take stand against the Shinra
to protect the Condor (of course you're going to say yes) and its egg, once
you have accepted you will then be able to make use of the beds on the lower-
right floor along with the save point (for free). You can also make use of
the shops on the upper-right floor.

Here is what you can buy from Fort Condor:

  DISC 1:

+-------------------------+  +--------------------------+
|        ITEM SHOP        |  |       MATERIA SHOP       |
|-------------------------|  |--------------------------|
|       Potion |  50 gil  |  |       Fire | 600 gil     |
| Phoenix Down | 300 gil  |  |  Lightning | 600 gil     |
|        Hyper | 100 gil  |  |        Ice | 600 gil     |
| Tranquilizer | 100 gil  |  |    Restore | 750 gil     |
|         Tent | 500 gil  |  |____________|_____________|
|______________|__________|

  DISC 2 & 3:

+-------------------------+  +--------------------------+
|        ITEM SHOP        |  |       MATERIA SHOP       |
|-------------------------|  |--------------------------|
|       Potion |   50 gil |  |       Throw | 10,000 gil |
| Phoenix Down |  300 gil |  |  Manipulate | 10,000 gil |
|        Ether | 1500 gil |  |   Deathblow | 10,000 gil |
|        Hyper |  100 gil |  |    Destruct |   9000 gil |
| Tranquilizer |  100 gil |  |         All | 20,000 gil |
|         Tent |  500 gil |  |_____________|____________|
|       S-Mine | 1000 gil |
|______________|__________|

On the upper-left shack you'll be able to view the Condor and its egg by
sitting at the viewpoint. You can also talk to the man there that will
trigger a Shinra attack, allowing you to take part in the Fort Condor Mini-
Game.

Before engaging in battle you must have 4000 gil as a reserve in your wallet.
If you wanted to you could just let the FC faction 'handle it themselves',
but to do this they must have 3000 gil in their wallet. Select 'Contribute
gil' to see how much funding they currently have, and to donate amounts of
500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 5000 gil. You will not receive any battle prizes
this way, and therefore  this is a pointless way to defeat the Shinra.

 NOTE - There will be battles that will be impossible to win seeing as you
        won't actually be able to take part in them for various reasons. These
        battles will be considered as 'won' provided the faction had enough
        gil to fight the Shinra, so make sure to donate at some point! No
        prizes will be given for these battles however.

--E.06 B - The Prizes


  There are some pretty decent prizes up for grabs, but you must win the mini-
game in order to win the prize; the game is considered 'lost' if one of the
enemies makes it to the shack, resulting in a mandatory battle with the CMD.
Grand Horn. Also, the battles themselves are usually only available for a
small window, and are very easy to miss completely.

If you were to lose/miss a battle then it is worth noting that you would not
lose the prize that was available, rather you would lose the final prize (if
that makes sense). So, let's say you took part in and won 10 battles, but you
had missed 3 of them along the way then your prize for your 10th battle would
be the same prize for the 10th battle, and *not* the 13th battle.

 NOTE - The final 'mandatory' battle is the only battle that is *not*
        considered lost if the CMD. Grand Horn reaches the shack; you'll still
        be able to retrieve the prizes (Huge Materia and Phoenix Materia).
        This is actually the recommended strategy as he'll drop the Imperial
        Guard, which is an awesome piece of armour.

| BATTLE 21 - This is a mandatory battle that is fought during the Huge      |
|             Materia Quest. You must fight and defeat the CMD. Grand Horn   |
|             in order to obtain the Imperial Guard.                         |
|   Enemies - 45                                                             |
|     Prize - Huge Materia, Phoenix Materia, Imperial Guard                  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

For the final fight you will not need to have 4000 gil as a reserve. Also, if
you were to lose to the CMD. Grand Horn then you would not be met with a
'Game Over' screen, instead you would just be kicked out of Fort Condor
forever, also losing the Huge Materia. If this happens then you can still
obtain the Phoenix Materia from Bone Village, see section E.12 for more info.

 NOTE - Although many of the items look fairly basic it is definitely worth
        completing at least 7 battles to obtain Yuffie's Superball, Red
        XIII's Magic Comb and the Peace Ring (the Peace Ring will massively
        help out at the Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim).

--E.06 C - About The Battles


  Including the final battle there are 15 battles to be fought. In order to
succeed you must defend yourself against a horde of Shinra that will try to
make their way up the side of the Reactor. If any single enemy makes it to
the shack at the top then you have lost the battle and will have to fight the
CMD. Grand Horn. To win you must defeat all enemies that appear, including
the Commander that appears at the very end.

 NOTE - It is possible to avoid fighting the Commander. If you were to defeat
        every single enemy that is in play before the Commander was to show
        up then you will win the battle automatically, regardless of how far
        into the battle you are; to do this you would have to go all out on
        the offensive. Similarly, if the Commander were to appear and you
        were able to defeat him then the battle would end instantly,
        regardless of how many other enemies were still left in play.

Before the battle begins you will be given the opportunity to place as many
units as you please (with a limit of 20), provided you have enough gil as
placing units down will cost you. This is why a 4000 gil reserve is necessary
to take part. You will only be able to plant your units roughly half way down
the field, a red line will indicate how far down you can go. You will also be
able to plant down units mid-battle, so you don't have to spend a bucket-load
before the battle has begun (I usually just plant 3).

**Any remaining units that are still alive at the end of the battle will be
  refunded to you at 200 gil per unit, regardless of how much they initially
  cost.

Once you have your starting line ready you can begin the game with X. Once
the battle has begun you can speed up the game by pressing R1 and slow it
down using L1, a white indicator at the bottom right hand side of the screen
will indicate the current game speed. The bar on the left hand side will
indicate how many enemies and allies are on the field along with the how far
up the Reactor the enemy is; once the enemy is roughly 7/8ths of the way up a
'warning' indicator will start flashing. Make sure to plant some units by the
shack if this happens. Note that you can also pause the game using Start.

To give a unit a command simply click and point to send one of your units
marching downhill towards the enemy. As your troops move downhill so will the
'red line', meaning you can plant fresh units right in the middle of the
battle ground if you wish. When a unit encounters an enemy a turn-based
battle will begin. You can take part manually by pressing confirm when
prompted, or you can let it play out automatically by pressing cancel
(recommended). By letting the battle play out automatically you will have the
time to keep your eye on what's going on over the whole playing field, you
can also try slowing down the speed whilst making decisions then speeding it
back up again when you're ready to proceed.

When it comes to choosing which units to select there should only be 3 that
you are interested in - The Attacker, The Defender and The Shooter. Think of
it as Rock, Paper Scissors; the three enemy types that you will encounter
(aside from the Commander) are Beast, Barbarian and Wyvern.

  Attacker - Defeats Beast     - Defeated by Barbarian - Cost 420 gil
  Defender - Defeats Barbarian - Defeated by Wyvern    - Cost 440 gil
  Shooter  - Defeats Wyvern    - Defeated by Beast     - Cost 520 gil

The Attacker moves the quickest, The Defender hits the strongest and The
Shooter can hit from afar. Also, The Fighter costs 400 gil, and while it has
no strengths/weaknesses it does hit for quite a lot and has decent HP. An
enemy that is weak against one of your units will receive double damage from
that unit whilst at the same time only delivering half damage, and vice-
versa. All of the other units aren't really that great, but can be used to
help you out if you wish. As you progress and complete more battles new types
of deployable units will become available, but as long as you know what
you're doing you should only ever have to rely on the 3 units as mention
above.

Here is a list of each unit available:
 _________________ __________ _______ _____ _______ ___________ ___________
|      UNIT       |   COST   | POWER | HP  | RANGE | STRONG VS |  WEAK VS  |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Fighter}       |  400 gil | 30    | 200 | 1     | N/A       | N/A       |

|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Defender}      |  440 gil | 35    | 220 | 1     | Barbarian | Wyvern    |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Shooter}       |  520 gil | 20    | 160 | 1 - 3 | Wyvern    | Beast     |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Repairer}      |  480 gil | 10    | 160 | 1     | N/A       | N/A       |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Worker}        |  400 gil | 10    | 160 | 1     | N/A       | N/A       |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Stoner}        |  480 gil | 20    | 100 | 1 - 4 | N/A       | N/A       |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Tristoner}     | 1000 gil | 35    | 150 | 1 - 5 | N/A       | N/A       |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Catapult}      |  480 gil | 18    | 100 | 1 - 5 | N/A       | N/A       |
|-----------------+----------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+-----------|
| {Fire Catapult} |  600 gil | 25    | 120 | 1 - 6 | N/A       | N/A       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 NOTE - The Tristoner is available after you have completed your 4th battle
        and the Fire Catapult is available after you have completed your 7th
        battle. They will both be available for the final battle regardless
        of whether or not you'd previously unlocked them.

A repairer will heal an ally for 10 HP per move. A worker will place a bomb
to surprise the enemy (allies cannot be harmed by bombs). The bottom 4 units
will all hit enemies from a distance, and are fairly useless although there
are times that their range comes in handy.

Here is a list of enemy units:
 _____________ _______ _____ _______ ___________ __________
|    UNIT     | POWER | HP  | RANGE | STRONG VS | WEAK VS  |
|-------------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+----------|
| {Beast}     | 25    | 180 | 1     | Shooter   | Attacker |
|-------------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+----------|
| {Barbarian} | 15    | 130 | 1 - 3 | Attacker  | Defender |
|-------------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+----------|
| {Wyvern}    | 20    | 140 | 1     | Defender  | Shooter  |
|-------------+-------+-----+-------+-----------+----------|
| {Commander} | 60    | 230 | 1     | N/A       | N/A      |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

Here is how much HP each unit takes and receives against each enemy:

--E.06 D - Battle Strategies

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.
  STRATEGY 1:- The Impatient  '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is basically the quickest and most offensive way to end the game and is
the strategy I always use. It is also the most proficient way to defeat the
Shinra.

1.) Before the battle begins place 3 Attackers as far down as they you can,
    spread evenly across the field (Attackers move the quickest).

2.) When the battle begins slow the speed right down then select each unit to
    move down towards the enemy. Speed the battle up again.

3.) Just before the troops engage each other, deploy some units that match
    the enemies weaknesses. Try not to over-populate the field; leave some
    space for new units to be placed.

4.) The idea is to completely over-run the enemy. As soon as they appear they
    are overwhelmed, and if the strategy is executed correctly then you
    should have won the battle in no time, ages before the Commander even
    appears.

5.) If the Commander does appear then select every unit in play to gang up
    upon him, but try to do so all at the same time. If anything, pull back
    certain units as so that they don't get wiped out, then when all of your
    units are close enough to him have every single one of them rush the
    Commander and he'll drop in no time.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.
  STRATEGY 2:- The Conservationist  '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most defensive strategy, and while not being the quickest or
cheapest it sure is the safest way to win.

1.) Before the battle begins set up a line of Fighters, Shooters, Stoners,
    Tristoners, Catapults and Fire Catapults.

2.) Once the battle has begun speed up the gauge all the way and just let the
    enemy come to you.

3.) As the enemy draws near make sure to deploy a few units that match the
    enemies weaknesses, although they should be fairly weakened by the time
    they engage you, provided you have placed all of your long ranged
    artillery in strategically advantageous spots.

4.) Don't be afraid to use a few Repairers seeing as they'll have enough time
    to do some healing, just don't forget to command them to do so.

5.) As with Strategy 1, when the Commander arrives have every ally cluster
    together whilst waiting for him to approach, then when he is close enough
    have every unit attack him. With Catapults, Stoners etc. he should fall
    without too much trouble.

Here are the enemy formations as they appear, this should help you with the
first two strategies (credit goes to Absolute Steve as the source):

| Beast     | --------- | STRATEGY 3:- The 'Can't Be Bothered'  '~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Barbarian | --------- |
| --------- | Wyvern    |  1.) Before the battle begins, do nothing!
| --------- | Beast     |
| --------- | Barbarian |  2.) When the battle begins speed up the gauge all
| --------- | Wyvern    |      the way. Do nothing else.
| --------- | Beast     |
| --------- | Barbarian |  3.) When the enemy reaches the shack, defeat the
| Barbarian | Barbarian |      CMD. Grand Horn. That's it!
| Barbarian | Barbarian |
| Barbarian | Barbarian |  This strategy is only recommended for two things.
| Beast     | Beast     |  Firstly, there is a very difficult to obtain item
| Beast     | Beast     |  called the Vagyrisk Claw, and although it can be
| Beast     | Beast     |  stolen from an enemy called Bagrisk it is much
| Wyvern    | Wyvern    |  easier to obtain by defeating a low level CMD.
| Wyvern    | Wyvern    |  Grand Horn. Just remember that you will not
| Wyvern    | --------- |  receive the prize for that battle if you opt to do
| --------- | CMD       |  this.
|___________|___________|

Secondly, when you are obtaining the Huge Materia you can acquire a very good
piece of armour called the Imperial Guard from the CMD. Grand Horn Lv 37, and
unlike the previous battles you *will* receive the prizes up for grabs if you
lose the Fort Condor Battle, which is the Huge Materia and the Phoenix
Materia. You must defeat the CMD. Grand Horn however or you would be forever
banned from re-entering Fort Condor!

| The CMD. Grand Horn Lv 37 will only be fought during the final battle for  |
| the Huge Materia, and cannot be fought prior to this battle.               |
|                                                                            |

| There are the 3 varying factors that contribute to whether you fight CMD.  |
| Grand Horn  Lv 19 or Lv 25.                                                |
| In the order that they are taken into consideration:                       |
|                                                                            |
| - The number of party members in the team                                  |
| - The Average party level.                                                 |
| - The battle rank alongside the quantity of enemies you killed in the Fort |
|   Condor Battle before an enemy reached the shack.                         |
|                                                                            |
|   If there are less than 3 members in the team then you will always face   |
|   the Lv 19 CMD. Grand Horn. This will take place during battles 2 & 3.    |
|                                                                            |
|   If the average party level is below 19 then you will always face the     |
|   level 19 CMD. Grand Horn. If the average party level is above 25 then    |
|   you will always face the CMD. Grand Horn level 25.                       |
|                                                                            |
|   If your average party level is between 19 - 25 then the battle ranking   |
|   system comes into play:                                                  |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| Battles 1-3 - Rank 1 - CMD. Grand Horn Lv 19 is always fought.             |
|                                                                            |
| Battles 4-6 - Rank 2 - CMD. Grand Horn Lv 19 is fought if 15+ enemies have |
|                        been killed, otherwise a CMD. Grand Horn Lv 25 is   |
|                        fought.                                             |
|                                                                            |
| Battles 7-9 - Rank 3 - CMD. Grand Horn Lv 19 is fought if 20+ enemies have |
|                        been killed, otherwise a CMD. Grand Horn Lv 25 is   |
|                        fought.                                             |
|                                                                            |
| Battles 10+ - Rank 4 - CMD. Grand Horn Lv 19 is fought if 25+ enemies have |
|                        been killed, otherwise a CMD. Grand Horn Lv 25 is   |
|                        fought.                                             |
|                                                                            |
| For some reason Aeris's level is not counted when finding the parties      |
| average level, although the sum will still be divided by three meaning you |
| will have a much greater chance of fighting a Lv 19 CMD. Grand Horn which  |
| is very handy to know if you're trying to obtain the Vagyrisk Claw.        |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

The last thing I'd like to mention before finishing with this section is
regarding a small glitch involving the Phoenix Materia. If you wish to
duplicate it (once only) then you mustn't run out of the shack to claim it
after winning the final Fort Condor Battle. Instead, leave it where it is and
wait until you get to Disk 3 (you'll still be able to grab the Huge Materia).
Then, dig up the Phoenix Materia from Bone Village (see section E.12). Return
to Fort Condor and run outside the shack to grab a 2nd copy of the Phoenix
Materia! For more glitches and exploits visit section E.18

--E.07 A - How To Obtain Yuffie


  Yuffie Kisaragi is one of two 'hidden' characters that can be recruited,
along with Vincent Valentine. See section E.10 for details on how to recruit
Vincent. Yuffie can first be obtained when Cloud reaches Junon Area just
after the Mythril Mine. It is very possible that you could miss out on
recruiting her at this stage, so take note of the fact that she can be
recruited at any point during in the game where Forests can be located.
Recruiting Yuffie will unlock the 'Yuffie' Trophy.

To obtain Yuffie you must first battle around in the forests until you
encounter the Mystery Ninja. Once she has been defeated you will be brought
to a non-World Map screen with a save point. *DO NOT* attempt to use the save
point as Yuffie will steal 200 gil from you and then flee from the screen. In
fact don't open the menu or do anything else that involves taking your eyes
off her; she is an expert thief after all.

 NOTE - If she does steal from you then you will have to battle around again
        until you re-encounter the Mystery Ninja. Also, when you have
        finished recruiting her she will return any gil to you that she had
        previously stolen.

When prompted, select the following dialogue choices to recruit Yuffie:

Yuffie: "You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!"
 Cloud: "Not Interested"

Yuffie: "You're pretty scared of me, huh!?"
 Cloud: "......petrified"

Yuffie: "I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!"
 Cloud: "Wait a second!"

Yuffie: "You want me to go with you?"
 Cloud: "......That's right"

Yuffie: "All right! I'll go with you!"
 Cloud: "......Let's hurry on"

 - Choosing an incorrect answer on the first question will result in you
   being forced into the menus, she'll then steal 200 gil from you.
 - An incorrect second response will lead to her running away stealing 500
   gil.
 - An incorrect third or fourth response will lead to her just running away,
   stealing nothing.
 - An incorrect fifth response will lead to you entering Yuffie's name. When
   you come out of that screen Yuffie will have stolen 700 gil from you.
 - If you attempt to make use of the save point then she'll steal 200 gil
   from you.

Also, each correct response given will raise Yuffie's affection towards you
by +2.

| Fire damage. A level 27, 32, 37 or 42 MN will use a 'Fire Veil' which      |

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you recruit Yuffie she will have equipped on her the Throw Materia, a
Carbon Bangle and the 4-Point Shuriken. All of Yuffie's weapons are long
ranged, and her Ultimate Weapon, The Conformer is the only weapon in the game
that can deal regular damage whilst using the Command 'Morph' (as opposed to
hitting for 1/8th of normal damage).

Yuffie also has a side quest that is regarded as the biggest side quest of
the game, and is mandatory to take part in should you wish to obtain every
piece of Materia. You will also not be able to complete the Turtle Paradise
Mini-Game (section E.03) if you do not partake in her sidequest. If you
haven't completed it by the time you have parachuted in on Midgar towards the
end of Disk 2 then you will have missed out on the quest completely.

--E.07 D - Glitches


  There are two glitches that are pertaining to the Yuffie recruiting process:

1.) More of an exploit than a glitch. To keep boosting Yuffie's affection
    towards you to a max of 30, you can choose the correct response 4 times,
    thus raising her affection value towards you by +8 in total. You can then
    select the incorrect response on the final option, repeat twice.

    The drawback is that she will steal 700 gil from you each time, although
    she will return all that she has stolen when you finally do recruit her.
    Repeating this glitch more than twice is pointless, as her affection
    cannot exceed 30 when recruiting her.

2.) Definitely regarded as a glitch, YUFFIE WARPING is something that can
    only be done on the PC/Steam version of the game. It involves warping
    your whole team, inventory, stats etc. from one save file to another. So
    basically, you could if you wanted to warp a save file containing Aeris to
    the beginning of Disk 2, or you could warp a level 99 Cloud back to the
    beginning of the game.

    This is done due to the fact that whilst recruiting Yuffie you are coming
    from a World Map screen (before the battle) to a Field screen (after the
    battle), and this is the only place in the game where this will occur.
    Poor programming allows the glitch to occur, see section E.18 C for a full
    rundown on how to perform the glitch. Here is a simplified version:

First you'll need to prime the save that you wish to load *FROM*. Make sure
that you haven't recruited Yuffie and that you have reached Rocket Town. Save
the game in the smaller of the two forests (where you'll encounter Yuffie
99.6% of the time).

Then load the save game that you wish to warp *TO*. Make sure to engage in a
non-World Map battle (World Map battle encounters will void the glitch).
During this battle you must allow all three characters to die as to return to
the main menu. Then load up the 'primed' save file. Battle around until you
face Yuffie, once she has been defeated instead of exiting to the save point
'recruiting' screen, you will have instead been warped to the battle that you
had previously died on. On the other save file! It's that simple!

This glitch will come with a number of bugs, and depending on the
circumstances it can freeze up your game.

--E.08 A - About The Gold Saucer


  The Gold Saucer is situated in the middle of Corel Desert and can only be
accessed via North Corel which is just north of the desert. Here you'll be
able to ride the tram up to the Gold Saucer, which is Final Fantasy VII's
epicentre of fun and games, not to mention great prizes. The Amusement Park
is spread across 8 floors. When you first enter the Gold Saucer you'll be
roughly 1/2 way into the first Disk, although you won't be able to explore it
properly until you have obtained the buggy.

When you arrive at the Gold Saucer you must pay 3000 gil to enter, or if you
can afford it you can choose to pay 30,000 gil for a lifetime pass (aka
Golden Ticket). You'll also notice a save point in the background, this can
only be used by spending 5GP.

GP (Gold Points) serve as the Gold Saucers form of currency, and until you
get to Disk 2 they can be very difficult to obtain; you must either win at
the Chocobo Races or win at the arcade games in the Wonder Square. When you
do reach Disk 2 you can amass large amounts of GP much more easily by
manually racing your own Chocobos at the Chocobo Square, until then the Super
Dunk game in the Wonder Square is probably your best option for racking up GP
early on in the game.

You can also exchange gil for GP by talking to the man that will appear
behind the save point at the Ropeway Station. This man will only appear from
Disk 2 onwards and has a 15% chance of appearing (roughly). He will exchange
100 gil for 1GP with a maximum of 100GP for 10,000 gil.

The main two reasons that you would want to amass a large amount of GP are
for the prizes that are available at the Wonder Square (obtained by trading
in your GP), and the prizes that are available at the Battle Square (costs
10GP to partake in a battle). There are also some great prizes that can be
won at the Chocobo Square, but these are more easily obtained once you have
started the whole Chocobo breeding process.

                                                              {Chocobo Square}

           |
  BETTING: |_________________________________________________________________

Before you have obtained your own Chocobos on Disk 2, the only way in which
you can partake in Chocobo Racing is to place a bet at the main central
Bookmaker's Office. The ranks are divided up into C, B, A and S ranks, the
higher the rank the better the rewards but the more the bet costs. On Disk 1
you will only have rank C & B to choose from.

To enter into the bets you'll need to pay 200 gil, then you have to pay an
additional price to place a bet; the price of the bet depends on which Class
you select:

 Class C - 100 gil
 Class B - 200 gil
 Class A - 300 gil
 Class S - 500 gil

Every time you bet on a race you will have a grid of 15 squares to choose
from; each square represents one possible outcome of the race and you can
select up to three of them. If you determine Chocobo 1, 4 & 5 to be the
Chocobos with the highest chance of winning, then you should put your money
on squares 1-4, 1-5 and 4-5.

7 of the 15 squares will yield a 'common' item, 5 will yield an 'uncommon'
item and 3 will yield a 'rare' item. The available items for that particular
race are chosen at random and are displayed in the bottom left hand corner of
the lobby screen.

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Chance of Winning...                      | Cumulative Chance: |
|-------------------------------------------+--------------------|
|            A Prize - 20 %   (3 out of 15) | 20%                |
|     A Common Prize - 46.6 % (7 out of 15) | 9.3%               |
|  An Uncommon Prize - 33.3 % (5 out of 15) | 6.6%               |
|       A Rare Prize - 20 %   (3 out of 15) | 4%                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

 TIP - Thanks to the help of Bellfell and Phiefer3, I have been able to work
       out a formula that yields a 40% average win ratio:

Find X using the table below, then multiply that figure by Stamina. Repeat
the process for all 6 Chocobos, then bet on the three with the highest result.

|____________________________________|_______________________________________|

To understand the maths behind the above tables, you must first understand
the formula behind it:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Top Speed / Maximum Top Speed (176 KPH) = X                                |
| Stamina / Maximum Stamina (999) = Y                                        |
| X * Y = % of maximum possible stat values                                  |
|                                                                            |
| SO                                                                         |
|                                                                            |
| If a Chocobo had a Top Speed of 113 KPH, then X would be 64.2%.            |
| If a Chocobo had 362 Stamina, then Y would be 36.2%                        |
| 0.642 * 0.362 = 23.24% of maximum possible Top Speed and Stamina           |
|____________________________________________________________________________|


I tried this method over 100 races, and I was able to win 40 of them. The
main problem is that you cannot determine a Chocobos Run, Acceleration,
Intelligence or Cooperation, so there is no way of accurately determining the
Chocobo with the greatest stats.

It is speculated that the rank of the jockey has an affect on the outcome of
the race, and there are 4 ranks that can be determined by the colour of the
Jockey - Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. If in doubt, try betting on the
highest ranking Jockey; again this is only speculation.

  |________________|_____|  of the 10 rare items appearing (Elixir downwards).

* - The Hi-Potion is actually glitched, and even though the dialogue box will
    display "Received Hi-Potion", you'll actually receive a Tranquilizer.


The prizes you get for betting are the exact same prizes that you get for
racing. You first get a taste of what the Chocobo Racing experience is like
when you attempt to leave Corel Prison; you have to win in order to be
allowed to leave (although you won't win a prize, other than that of
freedom). If you lose then you will be able to re-try as many times as you
like until you win, just be sure to pick up the Ramuh Materia whilst in the
Jockey's Room as you'll never again be able to re-visit that area.

You won't be able to race in the Chocobo Races again until you have completed
the Lifestream events in Mideel on Disk 2 (the Gold Saucer won't have re-
opened until that point). You can then catch and breed your own Chocobos to
race in the Chocobo Square. It is much safer to race your own Chocobo as
opposed to betting at the Bookmaker's Office seeing as all you will need to
do to guarantee a prize is to win the race. When you do win a race either
through betting or racing you will be able to choose your reward; you can
take either the Item or the GP. One of the main incentives to spend time
racing your Chocobos in the Chocobo Square is to gain high amounts of GP,
aswell as to help with the Chocobo breeding quest.

            |
  BREEDING: |_________________________________________________________________

Racing your Chocobos in the Chocobo Square is actually a requirement of the
breeding process. Every time your Chocobo wins its third race it'll be ranked
up to the next class, and a couple of highly ranked Chocobos will be more
likely to breed a 'special' Chocobo. Also, the higher the ranking of the
parents, the greater the racing stats will be of the new-born Chocobo.

For more details on Chocobo breeding see section E.14.
_________
         |
  ESTER: |____________________________________________________________________

To enter into a race you must talk to Ester who will be standing outside of
the Staffroom. She will only be present from Disk 2 onwards. Here you will be
able to choose which Chocobo you wish to race followed by which track you
would like to race on. For what it's worth, always pick the short track;
there is nothing worth noting about the long track other than the fact that
you'll be able to see a recurring Final Fantasy easter egg - The Moai Face.

If you have either Tifa or Cid in your party then there'll be a 50% chance
that they'll want to be the one to ride on the back of a Chocobo. It's
completely optional of course but it can be quite refreshing to see someone
else riding a Chocobo for a change, however it makes absolutely no difference
whatsoever to the Chocobos performance. If both Cid and Tifa are in your
party then Tifa will always be the one to ask.

 NOTE - I suspect that the developers chose Tifa and Cid to be the ones to
        partake in the races (and also the Snowboarding game) due to the fact
        that they are the two characters that you take control of whilst
        Cloud is 'unavailable' in Mideel. Perhaps originally the Gold Saucer
        was intended to be open for business during that time...

  {CHOCOBO RACING}: |_________________________________________________________

      Controls:-

   Left   | Left
   Right  | Right
   X      | Slow Down
   Sq     | Speed Up
   O      | Sprint (drains stamina)
   Start  | Pause
   Select | Toggle between Manual and Automatic
   R1+R2  | Holding together will slowly refill stamina

As soon as the race begins you're going to want to press Select to toggle
from Automatic to Manual. Then, you're going to want to hold down R1+R2 for
the remainder of the race so that you consistently replenish you stamina bar.
Then tap Square a number of times to speed up your Chocobo all the way, you
can even sprint if you like (with O) to get in the lead, just make sure to
save enough stamina for the final hurdle.

If you have a Green or Blue Chocobo then you'll find that you won't struggle
as much at particular points in the race. Due to hurried programming, the
'ability' of each Chocobo has been reversed - The Green Chocobo will find it
easier to traverse through the water section of the long course as well as
the space section at the end of the short course, while a Blue Chocobo will
make short work of the spiralling climb at the beginning of the short course.
Naturally the Black and Gold Chocobos won't struggle at all while a Yellow
Chocobo will struggle will all parts.

**Once the first two Chocobos have crossed the finish line you can end the
  race by pressing Start; you don't have to wait for all 6 Chocobos to cross
  the finishing line.

For information on how the racing stats work whilst breeding Chocobos, see
section E.10 E.
_________
         |
  TEIOH: |____________________________________________________________________

Every so often you be up against the well-known jockey Joe and his Black
Chocobo Teioh. Teioh's stats are always faster than yours and can be very
tough to beat at times. His Speed is always 10% higher than yours and his
Stamina is always 25% higher than yours, regardless of whether your Chocobos
stats are maxed out or not. And obviously being a Black Chocobo he can make
short work of the tracks environmental hazards.

It is extremely difficult to beat Teioh without the use of a Gold, Black or
Green Chocobo, so don't waste too much time trying. You'll have to really
exhaust your sprint to stay ahead of him, just make sure to save enough for
the final sprint otherwise you're screwed. Using the R1+R2 trick here is
paramount.

Teioh will never appear in Class C, however his encounter rate for the other
Classes are as follows:

 Class B - 12.5%
 Class A - 25%
 Class S - 50%

  SPECIAL PRIZES: |___________________________________________________________

If you manage to win 19 races with a single Chocobo then Ester will reward
you with five prizes that are available in Class S (but unfortunately not the
Magic Counter Materia):

Precious Watch, Chocobracelet, Cat's Bell, Sprint Shoes and Counter Attack

                                                               {Wonder Square}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.08 C - Wonder Square

--Items of Interest - Gil Plus Materia, EXP Plus Materia, Speed Source


  The Wonder Square will be your main source of GP whilst on Disk 1, and
although there are 9 games to choose from the only game that will really make
an impact on your GP wallet will be the Super Dunk game. It's recommended
that you play the Mog House game and the G-Bike game to win some one off
prizes - 30 GP and a Speed Source, respectively. The Snowboarding game is
also worth a blast as it's probably the most fun game to play, followed by G-
Bike.

 NOTE - When you first enter the Wonder Square you will automatically recruit
        Cait Sith onto your team, who will also come equipped with the mighty
        Manipulate Materia.

When you enter the 1st floor of the Arcade itself you will have three games
to choose from. In the 2nd floor you will have 6 games to choose from. Also,
there is a staff member on the 1st floor who will trade your GP for prizes:
 __________________ ________
|                  |        | - The Gold Ticket is a waste of GP and is much
|      PRIZE:      |  Cost: |   more easily obtained by paying 30,000 gil at
|__________________|________|   the Ropeway Station.
|                  |        |
|           Potion |    1GP | - The Carob Nut will be displayed as '????' and
|            Ether |   20GP |   can be easily obtained by stealing from the
|         X-Potion |   80GP |   Vlakorados near Bone Village. They are used
|      Turbo Ether |  100GP |   for breeding Chocobos.
|      Gold Ticket |  300GP |
|        Carob Nut |  500GP | - The Gil Plus Materia and the EXP Plus Materia
| Gil Plus Materia | 1000GP |   will both appear as '????'. There is only one
| EXP Plus Materia | 2000GP |   available of each and neither will become
|__________________|________|   available until you have reached Disk 2.

                                            |
  1ST FLOOR - {ARM WRESTLER} - COST 100 GIL |_________________________________

This game is situated to the left of the staff member. It is very easy to win
and only requires you to tap O as quickly as you can. There are two
difficulty settings:

 Sumo Wrestler (Easy) - Prize = 1GP
      Wrestler (Hard) - Prize = 2GP
__________________________________________
                                          |
  1ST FLOOR - {SUPER DUNK} - COST 200 GIL |___________________________________

This game is situated on the lower right hand side and is considered by many
to be the best source of GP for Disk 1. The game will require you to hold O
down for approximately 1/2 a second and timing it right will score you 1GP,
the idea is to chain as many baskets as you can to maximise your GP count.
Holding O down for too long or too short will result in a miss, the game will
then pay-out the GP that you've earned.

 NOTE - Thank xPsychoMantis a huge amount for this!
        Go to https://www.metronomeonline.com/ and set it to 120 BPM. It will
        take a while to get used to but eventually you will start to find a
        rhythm where you'll be scoring every time. It also helps greatly if
        you mute the Gold Saucer backing music. Simply push O for one beat.
        Try not to over think it; in fact try to think about something else
        while you are playing. Look away from the screen, but don't close
        your eyes and nod your head  slightly to the beep.

Every time you net a basket you will earn 1GP. Once you have scored 10
consecutive points you will be given the option to 'Double Down'. If you land
that shot then you will double your current score, if you fail the shot then
your score will be reduced to 1GP and the game will end. The highest chain
possible is 44 baskets which will land you a whopping 300GP, so it really is
worth investing a small amount of time into the game.

  1ST FLOOR - {WONDER CATCHER} - COST 100 GIL |_______________________________

On the back wall you'll find two machines that are good for eating up your
gil and that's about it. Each machine will spit out a random prize, the
prizes are as follows:
 _______________________   __________________
|                       | |                  |

|______________|________| |_________|________|   better than the left machine,
|              |        | |         |        |   but only marginally.
|       Potion | 39.06% | |  Potion | 39.06% |

|         3 GP |  8.99% | |    3 GP |     8% |   receive the Phoenix Down the
| Phoenix Down |  1.95% | |   Ether |  2.94% |   game will tell you that you
|    Megalixir |  0.78% | |  Elixir |  0.78% |   have received an Ether, and
|        80 GP |  0.39% | |  100 GP |  0.39% |   vice-versa.
|______________|________| |_________|________|
______________________________________
                                      |
  2ND FLOOR - {G-BIKE} - COST 200 GIL |_______________________________________

G-Bike is situated at the northern end of the room and is basically the same
game as the one played whilst escaping Midgar on the Highway. Press O to
swing the Buster Sword to the right and Square to swing it to the left. For
every enemy biker that you knock down you'll score 500 points, and you'll
lose 50 points every time the truck is hit.

The orange bikers shouldn't pose too much of a threat, it's the red bikers
you need to be wary of as their main strategy is to lure you away from the
truck, and while you are pre-occupied the orange bikers will then damage the
truck as much as they can. Don't forget that you can knock down an enemy by
colliding into him enough times, you can also create a domino effect if you
line them up right.

You will receive 2 GP for scoring between 5000 - 9999 and you'll receive 10
GP for scoring over 10,000. You'll also be rewarded with a one-off Speed
Source the first time you score over 10,000 points, which makes the G-Bike
game worth playing at least until you have acquired the bonus prize.

On the PS4 version, you can unlock the Corel's Angel Trophy by scoring 10,050
points or more on the G-Bike game. You'll also notice blue bikes amongst the
orange bikes; these appear to act in the same way as the orange bikes.

  2ND FLOOR - {CRYSTAL FORTUNE} - COST 50 GIL |_______________________________

Just to the right of the G-Bike machine you'll find the Crystal Fortune
machine. Each time you reach a milestone within the story the fortune will
change to match your current circumstances. The fortunes that will be given
are as follows:

|------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------|

Also take note of the fortune that Cait Sith read out to you when he forced
his way into your party - "What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose
something dear". I can only imagine that the 'pursue' part was relating to
the Black Materia and the 'losing' part is an obvious reference to the events
that take place at the end of Disk 1.

  2ND FLOOR - {MOG HOUSE} - COST 100 GIL |____________________________________

This machine is positioned on the right hand side and is worth playing just
once as you'll net a quick one-time-only 30GP. All you have to do is feed Mog
5 Kupo Nuts when prompted, and then 3 Kupo Nuts the second time. It's a
little boring to watch, but definitely worth it for the GP. Be sure to talk
to the person next to the machine to claim your reward.

  2ND FLOOR - {3D BATTLER} - COST 200 GIL |___________________________________

This machine is positioned in the centre of the room and is pretty much a
rock, paper, scissors type game that yields five opponents, each increasing
in difficulty as you progress. So difficult in-fact that many people stay
clear of this game altogether.

 Press  X for a Low Attack (Beats Mid, loses to High)
 Press Sq for a Mid Attack (Beats High, loses to Low)
 Press Tr for a High Attack (Beats Low, loses to Mid)

After you have successfully hit your opponent a number of times they will
drop to their knees, progressing you to the next round. Here are the prizes
up for grabs alongside the chances you have of winning:

The 5th and final battle is more of a joke enemy than a real one seeing as he
is completely invisible, and it is completely impossible to defeat him. Due
to the terrible chances that you have of even making it past the third round,
the most you can hope to regularly win whilst playing 3D Battler is 3GP.

  2ND FLOOR - {SNOWBOARDING} - COST 200 GIL |_________________________________

The snowboarding machine is situated on the left hand side and is only
available once the Gold Saucer has re-opened on Disk 2. Snowboarding is
definitely the most challenging of all of the Wonder Square games and is also
regarded as the most enjoyable. You'll have experienced it before seeing as
it's basically the same mini-game as the one at the Icicle Inn, but with
different courses.

As with Chocobo Racing, Tifa or Cid may occasionally ask to have a try on the
snowboarding machine (37.5% of the time). It makes no difference whatsoever
to the performance of the snowboard and is completely optional. If both Tifa
and Cid are present then Tifa will always be the one to ask.

 Awful and Bad are swapped in the PC      As with Technique, you'll start off
 version.                                 with 30 points.

  TIME ATTACK:

In order to unlock the Time Attack mode you must first score 70 points or
more (GOOD ranking) on a particular track, thereby unlocking Time Attack for
that track (you also must have also set a score on every track). Time Attack
is activated by grabbing the Yellow balloon at the beginning of the race, and
there are some additional options available in the menus. You can change the
floor to a chequered grid, change the ghost Mog's snowboard to a sleigh, you
can even replace Mog with a running Cactuar, but to do that you must first
unlock rank 'Super', which is no easy feat (Time Attack rankings differ from
the normal rankings).

To assist with obtaining a 'Super' ranking you must first obtain a 'Good'
ranking which will unlock the Silver balloon at the beginning of a track,
granting you a speed bonus and thereby making it possible for you to decimate
your old records.

Here are the Time Attack Rankings for each version of the game:

 NOTE - The correct display should be 01'29"999 as opposed to 1'29"99, I just
        didn't have room to fit everything in. Sorry!

  2ND FLOOR - {TORPEDO ATTACK} - COST 200 GIL |_______________________________

The Submarine machine can be found on the very left hand side next to the
Snowboarding machine. I'll be honest, the game is pretty boring and the
prizes are dull, although the Dragon Fang and the Dragon Scales will come in
handy at the Battle Square. You won't be able to play the game until you have
completed the submarine events mid-way through Disk 2. This is basically the
same mini-game as the one you'll have played at the end of that mission.

      Controls:-

   Up     | Descend         The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy
   Down   | Ascend          submarines, and there are 5 difficulty settings
   Left   | Left            to choose from. The higher the setting, the more
   Right  | Right           subs you will have to destroy and the more HP
   X      | Slow Down       each enemy sub will have. The easiest way to win
   Tr     | Speed Up        is to use your sonar to locate enemy Subs, then
   Sq     | Fire Torpedo    simply lock onto them and fire with Square. Your
   R1     | Sonar           score will be affected be the speed in which you
   R2     | Change View     destroy the enemy subs, the amount of damage you
   Select | Quit            take along with the current difficulty setting
                            you are on.

 NOTE - It doesn't matter in the slightest how high of a score you get, all
        that you need to do to win the prize is to beat the game. You will
        lose the game if the timer runs out and there are still enemy subs
        left to destroy, or you are destroyed yourself.

  The first time you enter the Battle Square you will be accused of
committing a massacre, you will then be thrown into Corel Prison (Provided
you have first recruited Cait Sith, which will happen automatically the first
time you enter the Wonder Square). You'll then have to wait until you have
obtained the Buggy before you can then enter the Battle Square properly, and
as you've probably figured by the name this is a place where you can put your
battle skills to the test for the chance to win some great prizes!

The only attraction at the Battle Square is the Battle Arena which will cost
10GP to participate in, and although competing is completely optional, you
will have to take part in one mandatory battle as per the story line. This
takes place just after you receive the Tiny Bronco and your reward for this
battle will be the Keystone. If you manage to win all of these 8 battles
within the Battle Arena then Dio (The owner of the Gold Saucer) will throw in
a Protect Vest and a Choco Feather as a bonus. You can also enter into a
'special' battle', the reward being the Final Attack Materia. See below for
more details.

  PRIZES: |___________________________________________________________________

You reward for winning at the Battle Square will be dispensed in the form of
BP (Battle Points), and the BP you obtain can then be exchanged for prizes at
the two consoles to the left and right of the entrance. The further into the
game you progress the better and cheaper the prizes will be.

 NOTE - **When you leave the Battle Arena your BP count will be reset to 0.**
          You must make sure to have enough GP (and time) on your hands to
          be able obtain the prizes that you are after; if you run out of
          GP then you will be forced to spend all the current BP you have,
          as you will lose all of it the second you step outside. 200GP+
          should be a sufficient amount, always remember to save your game
          just before coming to the Arena.

You can also obtain a pair of Sprint Shoes for free which is a really cool
accessory that will automatically put your character in Haste. To obtain the
Sprint Shoes you must first talk to the NPC that you see standing at the very
bottom of the stairs at the entrance to the Battle Square. After she has
commented on how she doesn't like fighters that are all talk, you can then
compete in the Battle Arena. Be sure to win all 8 battles, when you do you
will be able to talk to her again to receive the Sprint Shoes. This can only
be done once.

  {BATTLE ARENA}: |___________________________________________________________

The Battle Arena mini-game consists of 8 fights, each becoming more difficult
than the last. Most of the enemies that you engage here are ones that you
will already have fought before, however there are 2 enemies that are unique
to the Battle Square, and these are Ho-chu and Tonberry.

Only one player can fight at a time, and the HP, MP, Limit gauge status etc.
of the player when he/she went into the battle will be exactly same when they
come out of the battle, regardless of what happens inside the Arena. Because
of this, it's always advisable to make use of the Inn in North Corel before
ascending the Ropeway to the Gold Saucer. I would also recommend having your
Limit bar roughly halfway filled.

There are some enemies that will teach you particular Enemy Skills whilst
battling away, however once the battle has finished and you have returned to
the Battle Arena lobby you'll find that the Enemy Skills that you had learnt
will no longer be available on your skill list. You won't gain any EXP, AP or
gil and nor will any of the kills that you make count towards you Limit Break
levels, however the items that you consume *will* deplete as they normally
would, and any items you obtain via stealing and morphing will be added to
your inventory as normal.

 NOTE - Morphing the Ho-chu is the best way to obtain a third Ribbon after
        acquiring the Highwind.

After each fight you will have the option to either continue on fighting or
to finish the battle, retaining your currently accumulated BP. Should you
choose to continue on, and then die before making it to the next round, you
will lose all of the BP that you accumulated for the battle and the mini-game
would be considered lost. Should this happen then you would receive the
consolation prize, a 'Tissue' (which does absolutely nothing). The game is
considered won if you win all 8 battles, or you decide to end the battle
after a fight.

One of the biggest incentives to grind it out at the Battle Arena is for the
'Omnislash' prize, which is Cloud's Ultimate Lv 4 Limit Break technique and
is regarded as potentially one of the strongest attacks in the game.
Obviously you'll need to rack up a large amount of BP for this, and the
amount of BP you gain per battle is entirely based on which handicap you
receive at the end of each individual fight.

               |
  {HANDICAPS}: |______________________________________________________________


Very similar to Cait Sith's and Tifa's Limit Breaks, the handicap system
works much like a fruit machine's 'slots'. After each battle (provided you
have chosen to continue on) you will be presented with a spinning reel with 3
symbols on, and each symbol correlates to a handicap. You can slow the reels
down if you wish by tapping Square.

 NOTE - Timing is everything. Whilst slowing down the reels, try to press
        Square on the symbol *before* the one you are after, it's the same
        technique for rigging Cait Sith's 'Slots' (see section E.02 E).

The tougher the handicap, the bigger the BP reward. Below is a list of every
handicap, note that receiving any of the 'Materia Broken' handicaps will also
cancel any of the status effects of the equipped Materia i.e. Strength - 1
etc.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 NOTE - Use Ribbons or White Capes to help protect you from the Status
        changing handicaps. Also, you can use Smoke Bombs or the Exit Materia
        to escape mid-battle whilst keeping your BP. If you try to escape
        using R1+L1 however then you would lose all of your BP.

You start each battle with 10 BP. Each handicap you obtain you will receive a
small amount BP, however you'll only really start to see the big figures on
the final two reels; aim to get the easy handicaps until then. Although
aiming for the tougher handicaps for the final two fights can sometimes be
challenging, the BP reward is definitely worth the risk. The highest possible
amount that you can obtain in one battle is 12,576BP.

You do not need to try to 'preserve' the most rewarding handicaps for the
final 2 reels either,  such as 'All Materia Broken' or 'Green Materia
Broken'. The contents of each reel will be scripted in from the beginning of
each battle; nothing you ever land on will affect the line-up for the
following reels.

 NOTE - Whilst under 'Resist', you will still be able to undergo Status
        changes via the handicaps. Should this happen then you will not be
        able to remove the handicap unless you use White Wind or DeSpell.

Here are the BP rewards for each handicap, highest to lowest:

So the top 5 handicaps to watch out for on the final two rounds will be the
All Materia Broken, Magic Materia Broken, Weapon Broken, Item sealed and
Independent Materia Broken. Having said that, be mindful of the Weapon Broken
handicap as its effects will stack, leaving your physical attacks potentially
harmless. Use the Enemy Skill Goblin Punch if this happens.

           |
  ENEMIES: |__________________________________________________________________

As with the prizes, the enemies that you encounter will update firstly after
you've received the Tiny bronco, and then again once you've received the
Highwind on Disk 2. Seeing as the enemies on the first 'bout' are so weak, it
is recommended that you utilise the opportunity to obtain the invaluable
Champion Belt at an early point in the game.

**All enemies will have 200% of their normal HP along with 125% of their**
  Attack and Magic Attack.

There are two groups of enemies that will be selected at random, Group A and
Group B, the latter of which is usually slightly more difficult than the
former. Each group consists of 4 potential enemy formations for you to fight,
again selected at random. The enemy line-up for the final fight will be the
same for both groups.

|***The Tonberry and the Ho-chu are enemies that are unique to the Battle    |
|   Arena. The Ho-chu was originally intended to be found within the Ancient |
|   Forest, and the Tonberry was intended to be encountered at the Whirlwind |
|   maze (not to be confused with the Master Tonberry at the North Crater).  |
|                                                                            |

| - The Vlakorados has 66,666HP!                                             |
| - The Tonberry can kill you in one hit, so be sure to cast Death Force.    |
| - Use your characters Ultimate weapons if you have acquired them.          |
| - You can Morph the Ho-chu into a Ribbon.                                  |
| - Use armour such as the Mystile, Imperial Guard or Ziedrich.              |
| - Be sure to stock up on plenty of Smoke Bombs, Remedys, and Elixirs.      |
| - The Ghost Ship has a move that can eject you from battle, so disperse of |
|   it quickly using L4 Suicide.                                             |

  BATTLE STRATEGIES: |________________________________________________________

The first thing you should think about is preparation. Make sure to have
healed yourself at North Corel before entering the Battle Square, and also
make sure to have saved up a sufficient amount of GP. This is easily done at
the Chocobo races once you can race your own Chocobos. Aim to have your Limit
filled up halfway, and possibly even come equipped with Sadness to lessen the
amount of damage you take. The idea is to have your Limit bar filled for the
final fight, if it fills up sooner then you should rely on Deathblow (or
Goblin Punch).

 NOTE - If you wanted to you could fill up you Limit gauge all the way prior
        to entering the Battle Square, then equip the Mime Materia. Once the
        battle has begun, cast Haste, Regen etc. then cast your Limit Break
        and keep Miming it until you need to heal. Be sure not to equip any
        Counter Attacks if you plan to use this method.

You'll want to make use of Big Guard and Regen in every battle. You're also
going to want to use Materia such as Heal (Esuna), Counter Attack, HP Plus,
Luck Plus, (Command) Counter=Deathblow, Added Cut=Deathblow and even Steal as
Well=Deathblow. Ribbons are an absolute must, or failing that Added
Effect=Hades in your amour works really well although I would recommend using
that combo on your weapon. Before you obtain a Ribbon you'll need to rely on
the White Cape which will protect you from Frog/Small.

One of the most used commonly strategies is to make it to the beginning of
Round 8 (whilst aiming for the 'All Materia Broken' handicap), then use a
Smoke Bomb to escape from the battle retaining all of your accumulated BP.
You could also do the same with the Exit Materia, although it wouldn't be
much use to you if you've received a handicap that disables it. Do not run
away normally (by holding R1+L1) as it will register as a 'loss' and you'll
lose all of your accumulated BP (for that battle).

 NOTE - When you do receive the 'All Materia Broken' handicap, remember you
        can hold down confirm to auto attack, unless of course you need to
        heal.

Enemy Skills are a crucial element to the Battle Square and will really tip
the tide in your favour. Aim to learn Big Guard, White Wind/Angel Whisper,
Beta, L4 Suicide, Magic Hammer, Death Force, Dragon Force, Magic Breath and
Goblin Punch. For info on how to obtain each Enemy Skill visit section G.02.
Here's a top tip: If you were to receive the 'Weapon Broken' handicap
multiple times then the effects would stack and your physical attacks could
become useless. When this happens you can fall back on Goblin Punch which
will hit for 75% of your normal physical attacks, for 0 MP.

Seeing as the enemies have twice their normal HP and 1.25x their normal
attack and Magic, it's important to come prepared. Always have your player in
the back row accompanied by a long ranged weapon, or the Long Range Materia
(don't forget to move your player to the front row if you receive either the
'Independent' or 'All Materia Broken' handicap). Slash All or Double Cut are
a must, and make sure to have some solid armour equipped such as the Mystile,
which will grant your player incredible evasion stats. Failing that, the
Imperial Guard or the Ziedrich will fit nicely.

 NOTE - If you have been playing the game for a very long time then the 'Time
        x30' handicap could ruin your day. If the resulting damage is higher
        than your current HP then your HP will be reduced to 1, leaving you
        extremely vulnerable.

Provided that it doesn't morally displease you, you could utilise the W-Item
trick to duplicate yourself enough Elixirs, Smoke Bombs and other resources
to make your Battle experience that much easier. If you don't wish to use
glitches then be sure to spend any leftover BP on Remedies, as you'll need
them should you lose your ability to cure negative Statuses through Esuna or
White Wind/Angel Whisper. Also remember that Haste, Regen and Slow-Numb
*will* carry over through to the next fight, Death Sentence will not.

Here is a list of useful Items that will help you in the Battle Arena:

  SPECIAL BATTLE: |___________________________________________________________

Towards the end of the game you are going to be given the opportunity to
partake in a 'special' battle which is harder than normal battles. This
battle won't become available until you have in your possession the W-Summon
Materia, Omnislash and Cloud's Ultima Weapon. The earliest point in the game
that you can obtain all three items is just after you have defeated Diamond
WEAPON (just before you parachute into Midgar), after which you'll be able to
take out Ultimate WEAPON to receive the Ultima Weapon (which is Cloud's
ultimate weapon).

Once you have met the above conditions you will be able to talk to the clerk
behind the desk who will offer you the opportunity to fight in the special
battle. If you win all 8 rounds then you will be rewarded with the Final
Attack Materia, which can only be won once. You can also win some completely
useless prizes such as the Combat Diary, Autograph and Gambler. These items
serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. Only Cloud will be able to
participate in this 'special' battle.

 NOTE - The Final Attack Materia is extremely useful, especially when paired
        with Revive. It's definitely considered 'essential' when going up
        against either Ruby or Emerald WEAPON.

The enemies for this battle are pre-scripted and never change:
 ___________ _________________________
|           |                         | * = Susceptible to L4 Suicide.
| BATTLE 1: | Sea Worm                |
| BATTLE 2: | Ho-chu                  | The Sea Worm is vulnerable to Ice
| BATTLE 3: | Unknown 3*              | The Ho-chu is vulnerable to Water
| BATTLE 4: | Serpent                 | The Serpent is vulnerable to Wind
| BATTLE 5: | Wolfmeister             | The Wolfmeister is vulnerable to Water
| BATTLE 6: | Behemoth                |
| BATTLE 7: | Maximum Kimaira         | Winning 10 battles will net you a
| BATTLE 8: | Proud Clod, Jamar Armor | Ribbon, however it's much easier to
|___________|_________________________| just morph a Ho-chu.

The last few bonus prizes to mention are the Sprint Shoes that can be won by
first talking to the girl that is standing at the bottom of the stairway to
the Battle Square, then winning all 8 fights in (any) battle, and then
returning to her to claim your prize. You can also win two additional prizes
when you take part in the 'mandatory' battle after acquiring the Tiny Bronco;
win all 8 battles and Dio will reward you with a Protect Vest and a Choco
Feather, aswell as the Keystone.

                                                                {Ghost Square}

  The Ghost Square basically serves as an Inn where you can rest for 5GP. In
the 1st floor lobby on the left hand side you'll find the poster for the
Turtle Paradise Mini-Game (section E.03). Through the opening you'll find Mr
Hangman's shop, here's what he has to sell: (no variation between Disks)

--E.08 F - Round Square


  For 3GP you can ride the Gondola with a teammate of your choice. You'll see
a few scenes that weren't shown on the date, other than that there isn't much
point in spending too much time here. The date sequence itself is fairly
interesting as you'll be spending some quality time with either Aeris, Tifa,
Yuffie or Barret. Aeris's and Tifa's date will have a 'meaningful' feel to
it, and Yuffie's and Barret's date will have a 'comical' feel to it.

If you want to view the dialogue that takes place here for each character,
then you should visit section E.01 F.


                                                                {Speed Square}

--E.08 G - Speed Square

--Items of Interest - Umbrella, Flayer


  The Speed Square is home to one attraction only, and that is the 'Shooting
Coaster' which is basically a rollercoaster style shoot-em-up. The first time
you visits the Gold Saucer you'll be able talk to the owner, Dio, about the
Black Materia and a man in a hooded cape. Heading down the tunnel will lead
to the attraction itself. The ride costs 10GP to play, and isn't that great
in the way of rewards seeing as most of the prizes do absolutely nothing,
while the ones that are good for something require an insanely high score to
obtain:
 _______________________________________
| SCORE: |            PRIZE:            | - The Umbrella is a weapon for Aeris
|________|______________________________|   that has 0 Materia slots but
|        |                              |   incredibly strong attack power,
|        | Masamune Blade (50% chance)  |   and is best used for Yuffie's
| 3000+  | Super Sweeper  (25% chance)  |   sidequest.
|        | 1/35 Soldier   (25% chance)  |
|--------+------------------------------| - The Flayer is a weapon for Cid and
|        | Umbrella (once only, Disk 1) |   is the strongest weapon in the
| 5000+  | Flayer (once only, Disk 2)   |   game to have normal growth. None
|________|______________________________|   of its 7 Materia slots are linked.

While scoring 3000+ can be a challenge, scoring 5000+ can be near to
impossible without using an emulator. I suggest sitting down with youtube to
really learn the track and the position of every target, because as they say,
practise makes perfect! Use confirm to shoot the targets as they appear, but
be mindful of the power-bar to the left, the more it depletes the less power
your shots will have.

 NOTE - Do not let your Power meter run below 4/5ths. Quick, short bursts is
        what's required, especially for the big spaceship at the end!

Below is a list detailing each available target, along with how many points
each is worth and how many times they appear:
 __________________ ________ _______
|                  |        |       | - The Cactus comes in two different
|      TARGET:     | SCORE: | QNTY: |   forms.
|__________________|________|_______|
|                  |        |       | - The Cacti on Rocks is the last cactus
|            Ghost |    40  |  10   |   target that drops on top of a boulder.
|           Cactus |    30  |   5   |
|   Cacti on Rocks |    50  |   1   | - To find the Yellow Boulder you must
|       Blue Plane |    50  |   9   |   look out for the single Blue Plane in
|       Grey Plane |    50  |  11   |   the Canyon, just before it passes
|   Yellow Boulder |   200  |   1   |   you'll notice the Yellow Boulder at
|      Yellow Frog |    60  |   3   |   the top.
|  Red Water Wheel |   285  |   1   |
|      Yellow Star |    40  |  10   | - The Red Wheel appears just after
|    Flashing Star |    70  |   6   |   Yellow Frogs, and the longer you shoot
|           Icicle |    40  |  10   |   it the more points you accumulate with
|     Icicle Shard |    50  |   7   |   a  max of 285.
|          Balloon |    30  |  19   |
|    Large Balloon |    70  |   1   | - After the boss at the end you'll
|              UFO |    60  |   9   |   encounter one more Helicopter, Blue
|      Pink Rocket |    50  |   8   |   Plane and Grey Plane, each worth 10
|     Lava Boulder |    70  |   7   |   points more than normal.
|       Helicopter |    40  |   8   |
|       Flashy UFO |    80  |   8   | - As you're pulling into the station you
|  Large Spaceship |  1000  |   1   |   can try to shoot the second from last
| Secret Headlight |   200  |   1   |   headlight on the left for an
|__________________|________|_______|   additional 200 points.

There is also a 'Zeppelin Propeller' that can be shot for additional points,
however this is only achievable in the Japanese original, the PC and the PS4
release. Due to the amount of points available (30,440 total), this is
believed to be a glitch. The Propeller appears for two brief moments, and can
be found in-between the Pink Rockets and the Lava Boulders.

Again, you're really going to need some patience on this one. I suggest
saving before attempting to gain the Flayer (let's face it, there's no real
need for the Umbrella, unless you're going for 100%), and really memorising
the youtube vids; there's plenty out there!

                                                                {Event Square}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.08 H - Event Square


  The Event Square is basically a theatre that has got absolutely nothing
going on for the majority of the game, except for during the dating sequence.
Whilst you are with your date you will be chosen as the 100th couple (unless
you are with Barret, in which case this whole scene will be skipped entirely)
and you will be asked to perform in the play. You will then have multiple
dialogue options to choose from in which you can either aid the play to help
it run smoothly (but also boringly), or you can purposely muck up the lines
for a comical experience.

  As with the Elements, Status changes are a recurring trait that is used in
the Final Fantasy series. Very commonly a Status change will have a direct
effect on the way in which either the player or the enemy behaves. Some
Statuses will have positive effect, such as Haste, and some Statuses will be
negative, such as Poison. There are 26 'main' Statuses but there are actually
considered to be 35 in total.

 NOTE - The Ribbon is considered to be the best Accessory in the game, and it
        will protect you from the majority of negative Statuses. One can
        first be found in the Temple of The Ancients, the 2nd in Gaea's
        Cliff, and final piece in the Battle Square by Morphing a Ho-chu. It
        *won't* protect you from Death, Slow and Stop however.

Time based Statuses such as Death Sentence and Poison will usually affect
your players at a rate based on how fast your Battle Speed settings are set
to. My best advice is to set the ATB to 'Wait', and don't have the Battle
Speed set too high. This way you won't be penalised for spending a long time
selecting which command to use, or whilst watching the characters battle
animations play out.

Unlike a lot of other Final Fantasy games, most Statuses will *not* carry
over from battle to battle, the exceptions being Fury and Sadness. Both
Statuses will each have positive and negative effects; Fury will make your
Limits fill up quicker whilst making your attacks less accurate; Sadness will
make your Limits fill up more slowly whilst receiving less damage from
attacks.

White Wind is an incredibly useful Enemy Skill that is learnt from the
Zemzelett in Junon Area, and becomes available as soon as you obtain the
Manipulate Materia. It's effects will not only heal your HP but will also
cure you of most Statuses! The same goes for Angel Whisper, which is learnt
from the Pollensalta in the North Crater. Another great way to defend
yourself from Status ailments is to level the Heal Materia up to level 2 for
'Esuna', which will cure you of most bad afflictions.

There are three Statuses that will render you immune to all other Status
changes, and these are Resist, Petrify and Peerless. Petrify is very similar
to being K.O'd and Peerless is another term for Invincible (only Aeris's
Limits can grant the Peerless Status). Note that whilst under Resist you can
still undergo Status changes from the handicaps at the Battle Square, with
the additional effect of 'locking' the status in place, which is bad.

                                                                {Added Effect}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.09 B - Added Effect Materia


  Very much like the Elemental Materia, the Added Effect Materia will protect
you from a Status change if you pair it with the associated Materia whilst
placing it in your armour. Similarly, placing it on your weapon will make you
attack with the associated Status.

There is only one piece of Added Effect Materia in the whole game, and you
*must* obtain whilst traversing through the Cave of The Gi on Disk 1. If you
miss picking it up then you'll have permanently missed out on it, see section
D1.14 B for the walkthrough.

 NOTE - A Lv1 Time on your weapon paired with Added Effect *will* make your
        attacks hit with Slow and Stop, whereas a Lv1 Time paired with, let's
        say, Sneak Attack will only make your player caste Haste.

To see a full list of every Status that you are attacking with and defending
against, go into the 'Status' screen, then use confirm to navigate to the
Status tab (third one in). Not all available Statuses are shown within this
window - only 26 of the available 35 are shown.

You won't be able to fully utilise the awesomeness of the Added Effect
Materia until you manage to obtain the Hades Materia from the Sunken Gelnika.
Pairing them together will make you attack with/protect from: Sleep, Poison,
Confusion, Silence, Frog and Small. (Just) before you are able to grab the
Hades Materia you will be able to get the Contain Materia from Mideel, which
will make you attack/protect with/from: Confusion, Petrify and Stop
(regardless of what level Contain is at).

Here is a list of every piece of Materia that is pairable with Added Effect:

   MATERIA:   |  INFLICTS/DEFENDS:         |  FOUND:
              |                            |
   Poison     |  Poison                    |  Hojo's Laboratory
   Choco/Mog  |  Stop                      |  Chocobo Ranch
   Seal       |  Sleep, Silence            |  Junon
   Transform  |  Frog, Small               |  Mt. Corel
   Mystify    |  Confusion, Berserk        |  Gongaga Village
   Time       |  Slow, Stop                |  Gongaga Village
   Destruct   |  Death                     |  Shinra Mansion
   Odin       |  Death                     |  Shinra Mansion
   Contain    |  Confusion, Petrify, Stop  |  Mideel
   Hades      |  Sleep, Poison, Confusion, |  Sunken Gelnika
              |  Silence, Frog, Small      |

From what I can gather, each Status that is paired to you weapon will have a
31% chance of inflicting the enemy with that Status when attacking. That's
31% per each individual Status, not the Materia itself i.e. with Hades it
*won't* hit with all or nothing if you catch my drift. Thanks to NFITC1 for
clarifying that figure (31%).

This chart depicts the amount of enemies that are immune (IMM) and vulnerable
(VUL) to each Status:
                                        (There are 295 enemies in total. 4 of
                                           these will be fully cured by Death)
 _________________________________     ______________________________________
|  STATUS   |  IMM  ||     VUL    |   |     STATUS     |  IMM  ||     VUL    |
+-----------+-------++------------+   +----------------+-------++------------+
| Death     |  102  ||  189 (64%) |   | Frog           |  216  ||   79 (27%) |
|-----------+-------||------------|   |----------------+-------||------------|

| Poison    |   77  ||  218 (74%) |   | Petrify        |  121  ||  174 (59%) |
|-----------+-------||------------|   |----------------+-------||------------|
| Confusion |  153  ||  142 (48%) |   | Death Sentence |  127  ||  168 (57%) |
|-----------+-------||------------|   |----------------+-------||------------|
| Silence   |   81  ||  214 (73%) |   | Manipulate     |  157  ||  138 (47%) |
|-----------+-------||------------|   |----------------+-------||------------|
| Slow      |   27  ||  268 (91%) |   | Berserk        |  127  ||  168 (57%) |

| Stop      |  111  ||  184 (62%) |   | Paralyzed      |  126  ||  169 (57%) |
+---------------------------------+   +--------------------------------------+

Slow is by far the best Status to equip on your weapon, followed by Silence,
Sleep and then Stop. Dis-regard Poison as the Status isn't really effective
enough to consider using it. Before you can acquire Hades and Contain, the
two best pieces of Materia to link with Added Effect are Time and Seal, both
of which you will have obtained by the time you acquire Added Effect.

Seeing as you cannot exactly inflict Near-death on an opponent, there is no
need to include it on this list. The same applies for Sadness, Fury, Slow-
Numb and Darkness. Saying that, Darkness *can* be inflicted on an opponent,
but due to poor programming it will not have any effect on them whatsoever
(rendering the item 'Ink' useless).

 NOTE - The only way to inflict Fury on an enemy is to have a player use a
        Hyper in-battle, then inflict that player with Confusion before he's
        managed to cast it, then hope that the enemy is hit with the Hyper. If
        you are successful then the opponents accuracy will have dropped by
        30%, which is the only way of inflicting the 'Darkness' effect.

--E.09 C - Additional Information


 1) COLOUR PRIORITIES:

If your character is inflicted with a particular Status then he/she will
sometimes turn a specific colour. If that character is inflicted with more
than one Status then the game will choose which colour you character should
be based on the colour priorities as follows:

H  | Slow-numb | Poison | Berserk | Peerless | Darkness | Regen  | Manip. |  L
I  |___________|________|_________|__________|__________|________|________|  O
G  |           |        |         |          |          |        |        |  W
H  |   Grey    | Green  |   Red   |  Yellow  |  Black   | Orange |  Cyan  |


 2) STATUSES THAT NEGATE EACH OTHER:

Some Status changes will cancel out certain other Statuses:

Death/K.O. - negates - All other Statuses (excluding Frog and Small)
Sleep      - negates - Manipulate
Stop       - negates - Manipulate
Paralyzed  - negates - Manipulate
Petrify    - negates - Manipulate and Slow-numb
Sadness    - negates - Fury
Fury       - negates - Sadness
Haste      - negates - Slow
Slow       - negates - Haste

 3) {DESPELL}:

DeSpell is obtained via a level 2 Destruct, and will clear Haste, Slow, Stop,
Regen, Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect, Shield, Death Force and Resist. You could
also use a Holy Torch to cast Despell, however you would *not* clear Death
Force or Resist that way. DeBarrier will only clear Barrier, MBarrier,
Reflect and Shield.

Gi Nattak is the only enemy that will cast DeBarrier, and only the Valron and
Safer�Sephiroth will cast DeSpell, however Emerald WEAPON has several moves
that act as DeSpell would.

 4) TIFA'S POWERSOUL AND MASTER FIST:

There are two weapons that Tifa uses that are greatly enhanced when Tifa is
inflicted with various de-buffs:

{Powersoul} - Found in a chest at Mt. Nibel. Attack= 28. 4 x unlinked slots,
              double growth. When Tifa is inflicted with Death Sentence the
              attack power is quadrupled, and when she is in Near-death the
              attack power is doubled. Effects stack for a maximum of 8x
              normal power.

{Master Fist} - Found in a chest in the Shinra HQ on Disk 2. Attack= 38. 6 x
                unlinked slots, normal growth. When Tifa is inflicted with
                either Near-death, Poison, Sadness, Silence, Slow or Darkness,
                her attack power will be doubled, and when she is inflicted
                with Death Sentence or Slow-numb her attack power will be
                tripled. Effects stack for a maximum of 11x normal power.

 5) {CURSE RING}:

Found on Disk 2 during the Mideel sequence (before it has been destroyed),
and then again from Ultimate WEAPON by stealing from it (aerial fight only).
It is possible to miss the Curse Ring completely.

The Curse Ring will grant the bearer +35 Strength, +35 Magic, +15 Vitality,
+15 Spirit, +15 Dexterity and +10 Luck, but will also inflict Death Sentence
at the beginning of each battle. This is easily overcome by casting Death
Force, wearing Added Effect=Destruct or just by killing your foes quickly.
Tifa is the best candidate for the Curse Ring as her aforementioned weapons
will gain a considerable boost in attack power when under Death Sentence.

 6) CONTAIN:

At level 1, Contain (Freeze) will potentially inflict Stop. At level 2
(Break) it may inflict Petrify, at level 3 (Tornado) it may inflict Confusion
and at level 4 (Flare) it will not cause a Status change. Pairing Contain
with Added Effect will grant all 3 effects, regardless of the level of
Contain.

 7) OTHER RANDOM BITS OF INFO:

 - Esuna will not heal Slow or Stop.
 - Vincent in Limit Break mode and Sephiroth in the flashback gain immunity
   to Berserk, Frog and Confusion.
 - If a target is immune to a Status then the word 'miss' will not appear
   above their head when a Status changing move is cast on them.
 - Under the Peerless Status you will still be susceptible to Imprisoned.
 - White Wind and Angel Whisper will not cure Fury or Sadness, however
   sleeping at an Inn will.
 - If a target is immune to either Slow or Haste then they will have immunity
   to both Statuses. If a target is immune to Death then they are immune to
   Death Sentence (but not vice-versa).
 - Some creatures are weak to Statuses and will take double damage when using
   certain Status changing attacks, Such as Palmer who is weak to Sleep.
 - The Ribbon will protect against all negative Statuses excluding Death,
   Slow and Stop. You will still be able to inflict yourself with Fury and
   Sadness outside of battle using Hypers and Tranquilizers.
 - {Dual} is a dummied out Status and it is unclear what it was intended for,
   although when using a gameshark, 'Dual' will be displayed as the name for
   the Status Seizure.


������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.09 D - Negative Statuses (15)


  The Ribbon is the best Accessory to use to defend yourself against negative
Statuses, as it will protect you against most of them excluding Death, Slow &
Stop (but including Fury, Sadness and Berserk).

 NOTE - Seeing as Fury, Sadness and Berserk have attributes that, depending
        on your battle style, could be considered as positive OR negative, I
        have categorised them in their own section - Supportive Statuses. I
        have also included Manipulate in there.

Using Resist (Lv3 Heal) or a Vaccine will make your characters defend against
any Status, good or bad. Unfortunately, if you already had a nasty Status at
the time of Resist being cast, then that Status would be 'locked' onto your
player until the end of battle (this is particularly bad during the Battle
Square). Resist does not have a time limit, and can only be removed using
DeSpell or White Wind. Positive Statuses do not get locked.

Due to the nature of the way in which Statuses work, I have decided not to
list every enemy that is strong/weak against each Status area-by-area (as I
have done with the Elements), as this would require 295 entries per Status
over 16 Statuses (4720 entries). Noooooooo....

+-------------+
|   {DEATH}   |  Visual: Character lies lifeless, HP is in red.
+-------------+

If you are hit with Death then your HP will drop to 0 and you'll be instantly
K.O'd. This differs from the K.O. Status slightly and would be better known
as Instant-Death (or Sudden Death). There are 102 enemies that are immune to
the Death Status and 189 enemies that are vulnerable. Unfortunately, the
Ribbon will not protect you from Death.

The time to protect yourself from Death would be at the North Crater, where
there are 8 different attacks that can inflict Death upon you. Also, some
Undead creatures will be fully healed by casting Death upon them, namely the
Ghost, Zenene, Ghost Ship and Dragon Zombie. Regen however will *not*
gradually harm them as it is not of the Element Restorative. You first obtain
a Death based Materia when you reach Nibelheim; Odin. Shortly after you'll
receive the Destruct Materia.

The Resist Status will also protect you from (instant) Death, as will the
Enemy Skill Death Force. Just remember that DeSpell or White Wind will remove
the Death immunity. Also, when you are K.O'd you will be cured of every other
Status, excluding Frog and Small.

 NOTE - If an enemy is immune to Death then some of the below attacks will
        use an alternative attack that damages the opponent/s normally, such
        as Vincent's Satan Slam, or Odin's Steel Blade Sword (Gunge Lance will
        be used instead). Other attacks will simply miss.

+============================================================================+

+------------------+
|   {NEAR-DEATH}   |  Visual: Character kneels down, HP is in yellow.
+------------------+

When one of your characters HP falls below 25% they will be considered in the
'Near-death' (or 'Critical') Status. The only way you can be cured is by
healing your character as normal, this wouldn't really be regarded as a
'traditional' negative Status. There are only a few ways in which this can
affect the you other than aesthetically:

Tifa has two weapons that will double in attack power when her health is
critical, these are the Master Fist and Powersoul. The attack power will also
triple if she is inflicted with death Sentence (effects stack).

There are two weapons that have attack power that is proportionate to the
wielders HP, and these are: Ultima Weapon (Cloud's ultimate weapon) and HP
Shout (Cait Sith's ultimate weapon). The attack power of these weapons will
drop considerably when in Near-death, and the Ultima Weapon will turn blue.

Strong Gravity based attacks such as Demi3 will place your characters into
Near-death (unless you have Elemental counter-measures in place). Some of the
final bosses in the game will use attacks that will drop your HP straight
into critical. Should you wish to inflict Near-death upon an enemy then the
only two moves you can consider are L4 suicide and Demi3.

+-------------+
|   {SLEEP}   |  Visual: Character kneels down, Zzz appears above head
+-------------+

Whilst inflicted with Sleep you won't be able to select a command. The Status
will wear off after 12 turns (approx), or until you are hit with a physical
attack (a magic attack won't count). You obtain your first Sleep based magic
(Seal Materia) on your first visit to Junon.

 NOTE - It's pretty difficult to explain how the time units work, explore
        TFergusson's Battle Mechanic FAQ for more info. You characters
        Dexterity , the ATB settings ('Wait' or 'Active') and the Battle
        Speed itself will vary the amount of turns your character is
        affected by a particular Status.

There are 96 enemies that are immune to Sleep, and 199 enemies that are
vulnerable, making the Seal Materia one of the best Materias to equip on your
weapon at an early point in the game (you'll also hit with a chance of
inflicting Silence). The Enemy Skill Frog can be used to cure you of Sleep
but only if you are inflicted with Frog also.

Later on in the game when you have managed to obtain 3 copies of the Added
Effect Materia (by mastering two of them), you could try equipping all three
characters with Seal on their weapons to potentially keep your enemies in a
state of permanent sleep!

|    POISON    |  Visual: Character kneels down, flashes green
+--------------+                                               {Poison Status}

If your character is afflicted with poison then they will periodically lose a
small chunk of health, specifically 1/32 of their Max HP (3.125%) will be
deducted every 1.5 turns (approx) until they are cured or the battle ends.
Unlike other games in the Final Fantasy series, Poison will not remain with
the character post battle. You first obtain the Poison Materia when you raid
the Shinra HQ on Disk 1.

It's important to note that the Poison Element and the Poison Status differ
from each other in the sense that while an attack may hit you with Poison
Elemental damage, it may not inflict you with the Poison Status, and vice-
versa. 77 enemies are immune to Poison and 218 are vulnerable.

If you 'Nullify' Poison (Lv2 Elemental) then you would also by default be
considered 'Immune' to the Poison Status. If you were to 'Absorb' Poison (Lv3
Elemental) then being inflicted with the Poison Status would result in you
being healed by the infliction instead of being injured by it. Similarly,
being Immune to the Poison Status (Added Effect, Star Pendent) also means
Nullifying any Poison based Elemental attacks.

The last few thing to mention are: Lucky 7's. If you are afflicted with the
7777 Fever buff then you will receive 7777 HP worth of damage from the Poison
Status (which will mean Death). Also, the damage from Poison is considered to
be a self-inflicted hit, meaning your Limit gauge will not fill up nor will
you Counter Attack. If you receive Poison damage whilst in 'Defend' mode then
not only will you be taken out of defend, but also the damage will not be
reduced as the Poison (Status) ignores all defences.

 NOTE - If an enemy's HP is over 30,000 HP then they cannot be sensed. Their
        HP can then be worked out by Poisoning them, or by using Chocobuckle.

|   {CONFUSION}   |  Visual: Character spins around in circles (on axis)
+-----------------+

Whilst under Confusion (or Confuse, or Confu), a character will act of his
own accord and you'll lose complete control of him/her, very similar to
Berserk . The difference being that the afflicted player could also attack an
ally; whomever they happen to be facing at the time their ATB gauge fills up
will be the confused players next target, including themselves. Similar to
Sleep, the affliction can be cured by physically attacking the player.

Confusion is one of the worst Statuses in the game, and improper defences
could very easily lead to a Game Over screen. The most notorious locations
for having to deal with Confusion are the Shinra Mansion, where many
inexperienced players meet their demise against the Dorky Face, and then at
Gaea's Cliffs when you first meet the Malboro.

 NOTE - You can obtain a Peace Ring very early on in the game; by completing
        (and winning) 2 Fort Condor Battles. The Peace Ring's info is
        misleading in the PSX NTSC version, as it will not tell you that it
        protects from Confusion, however when you check the Stats screen
        you'll see that you are indeed protected.

There are 153 enemies that are immune to Confusion and 142 that are
vulnerable. The first time you can obtain a Confusion based Materia (Mystify)
is on your first visit to Gongaga, you will also find that a Lv3 Contain
(Tornado) will have a chance of inflicting Confusion, however you will be
granted Confusion when pairing with Added Effect with Contain regardless of
the level of the Contain.

If an enemy is inflicted with Confusion then the AI script will continue to
run as normal, only the 'Enemy' and 'Ally' flags will be reversed. If an item
is chosen by a player as their next move and that player then becomes
inflicted with Confusion, they will still continue to cast the selected item
only the target will now be chosen at random. This is the only way to inflict
an enemy with Fury.

|   {SILENCE}   |  Visual: Speech Bubble "........" appears overhead
+---------------+

Silence (also known as Mute) will have the effect of disabling all magical
spells, Summons and Enemy Skill attacks and will last until the end of battle
or until the affliction has been cured. 81 enemies are immune to Silence and
214 enemies are vulnerable. You can first obtain a Silence based Materia
(Seal) when you first visit Gongaga.

Due to the large quantity of enemies are weak to Silence, I would definitely
say this is one of the better Statuses to whack on your weapon, as there are
a large number of enemy attacks that would be better off 'Silenced'. The
Ribbon is the only accessory that will defend against Silence.

|   {SLOW}   |  Visual: Character animation speed is halved
+------------+

The effect and the Status name are the same thing. You're characters ATB
gauge will fill up at half its normal rate, and will last until you are cured
or the battle ends. 27 enemies are immune to Slow and a staggering 268 are
vulnerable, making the Time Materia one of the best choices to pair with
Added Effect (which is first available in Gongaga).

Strangely enough, if you were to pair Time with Added Effect on your armour
then you would also gain immunity to Haste, even though this would not be
displayed on the Status screen. Equipping the Sprint Shoes would bypass this
immunity. Slow is one of 3 Statuses not covered by the Ribbon (along with
Stop and Death). Although Hades will inflict Slow when you summon him in-
battle, he will not grant Slow when using Added Effect. Esuna will not heal
Slow.

If you are inflicted with Slow then the benefit would be that some certain
effects such as Barrier, MBarrier, Slow-numb and Death-sentence will take
twice as long to wear off/count down. Slow can be cured by casting Haste on
the afflicted player, as can DeSpell. The most notorious area in the game for
having to deal with Slow is right at the beginning of the game in the Winding
Tunnels when fighting the Grashtrike. It is recommended that you turn the
Battle Speed up all the way for these encounters.

|   {STOP}   |  Visual: Character animation completely stops
+------------+

There are 4 Statuses that render you incapacitated, and Stop is considered to
be the 2nd worst of them. The afflicted players ATB gauge will stop filling
up altogether and will last approximately 7 turns, or until the Status is
cured. There are 111 enemies that are immune to Stop and 184 enemies that are
vulnerable. The Time Materia can be bought from Gongaga.

A level 1 Time will still grant Slow and Stop when paired with Added Effect,
and is a brilliant choice up until Hades and Contain become available. You
cannot gain Stop from Hades, however you can gain it from Contain (along with
Petrify and Confusion), and also Choco/Mog, however the C-Mog is best
reserved for the Elemental Materia (I call it the 'C-Melemental', or even,
'the C-Mental combo').

Along with Slow and Death, Stop is one of the 3 Statuses not covered by the
Ribbon's effect. One of the slight benefits to Stop is that Barrier,
MBarrier, Regen etc. will also halt. The only difference between Stop and
Paralyze is the fact the you Limit Break *will* continue to fill whilst
'Stopped', whereas under Paralyze your Limits won't continue to fill,
although Paralyze does last roughly less than half the time of Stop. Esuna
will not heal Stop.

|   {FROG}   |  Visual: Character turns into a small frog
+------------+

Frog can be a real nasty Status if you're not adequately prepared, as you
will pretty much lose the ability to do everything! All you'll be able to do
is attack with 25% of your normal attack power (but not Limit Breaks), and
use the Item command (including W-Item). There are 216 enemies that are
immune to Frog, and only 79 that are vulnerable making Frog one of the worst
Statuses to use against the enemies.

 NOTE - Unlike all other Statuses, Frog and Small will still be in effect
        after the afflicted character is K.O'd.

Whilst inflicted with Frog you will still be able to use the command 'Toad'
to cure yourself, so long as you have the Transform Materia equipped (bought
from North Corel) or the Master Magic. The effect will last for as long as
the battle does, or until you are cured. You could also use the Enemy Skill
Frog Song to cure yourself, but you would have to be afflicted with Sleep
also for the cure to work.

Without a White Cape to protect yourself you'll soon realise why Frog is such
a pain when you first make your way through the forests of Gongaga. The Touch
Me have a 6x formation (so no escaping), and will keep you in a state of
permanent Frog. The Enemy Skill Frog Song is learnt here. Frog will also ruin
your day at the Battle Arena as it seems to appear quite frequently,
particularly in the lower rounds (Frog and Small have a chance of appearing
on every reel).

|   {SMALL}   |  Visual: Character shrinks to roughly 20% of their normal size
+-------------+

Small (also known as Mini) isn't too detrimental provided you've got some
form of counter measure such as Esuna or White Wind equipped. You will still
be able to use every command as normal, only now your physical attacks will
inflict no more than 1 HP of damage! The effects will last until the battle
ends or the player is cured. 171 enemies are immune to Small and 124 enemies
are vulnerable, the Transform Materia can first be obtain in North Corel.

If you are K.O'd whilst 'Small' then you will not revert back to normal, the
same applies with Frog. There is only one point in the game that you need to
be wary of Small and this is when you're fighting the Hungry in Corral
Valley; they can remove a player from battle after that player has been
reduced to Small. The most common way of inflicting Small on an enemy is with
L4 Suicide, although Small usually isn't the desired effect.

Whilst traversing through the Cave of The Gi you will encounter a powerful
spider-like creature called Stinger. Using Mini on him is the best way to
deal with him, as his attacks are powerful enough to kill you in one blow.
There are very few enemies that will inflict you with Small. If you happen to
be inflicted with Petrify then you would be immune to every single Status
change... except Small that is.

Casting Small on your characters is a strategy used to activate 7777 Fever.
For more info use QSI Link [7777 Fever].

|   {SLOW-NUMB}   |  Visual: Character flashes grey, 30 second timer appears
+-----------------+

Also known as Slow Petrify, or Gradual Petrify, Slow-numb is a countdown to
the Status Petrify, which takes effect after approximately 6 turns. When you
are afflicted with Petrify you are flagged as 'Dead', and if all three of
your players become Petrified then you would be met with s Game Over screen,
and as such Slow-numb is a forced to be reckoned with; use Jem Rings and
Safety Bits.

There are no ways in which you can inflict Slow-numb, although there are
several ways in which you can inflict Petrify. Due to the similarities
between Slow-numb and Petrify I have combined the two 'associated Materia and
item/enemy attacks' sections below. The timing mechanisms of the game result
in Slow-numb being very dangerous at slow speeds, so it is recommended to
have your Battle Speed bar at a minimum of half way.

If you become inflicted with Slow-numb in the Battle Arena then the countdown
timer will carry through to the next round (Death Sentence however will not).
You must cure yourself otherwise the battle will be lost, use a Soft to cure
you from both Slow-numb and Petrify.

the only way to actually inflict Slow-numb on an enemy is through
Manipulating a Gagighandi or an Under Lizard.

+---------------+
|   {PETRIFY}   |  Visual: Character turns grey, animation completely stops
+---------------+

Petrify (or Stone) is one of the worst Statuses to fall victim to for
noobies, as a Petrified player is flagged as dead, which means 3 Petrified
players results in Game Over. No change can happen to the players HP, MP or
Status whilst Petrified, although funnily enough there is one exception; the
player can still be inflicted with Small. The affliction will last as long as
the battle lasts, or until they are cured. Petrified players will not receive
any EXP or AP. 121 enemies are immune to Petrify, 174 are vulnerable. Petrify
is first available on Disk 2 when you obtain the Contain Materia.

Of all 8 enemy attacks that inflict Petrify on you, only four of them
actually inflicts actual 'Petrify'; the rest inflict you with Slow-numb
(which helps). The Bagrisk is an enemy that holds an extremely rare item
called the Vagyrisk Claw, which can inflict Petrify on one target. The higher
your current level the lower the chance you'll have of stealing the item;
past level 78 and you'll have lost it forever. The only other place to obtain
one is from a Lv 19 or Lv 25 CMD. Grand Horn.

 NOTE - An opponent that is defeated through Petrification will yield no
        battle spoils. This helps for low-level challenges.

The most iconic place in the game that people remember for being wiped out by
Petrify is the Gagighandi in the forests near Gongaga, you won't have any
protection at that point so make use of Softs and White Wind (where would we
be without White Wind). Speaking of which, when you cast White Wind on an
Undead enemy it will also inflict them with Petrify.

+============================================================================+

+----------------------+
|   {DEATH SENTENCE}   |  Visual: Character kneels down, timer appears
+----------------------+

Also known as Doom, Death Sentence will act in virtually the same way as Slow-
numb, the main difference being that the countdown timer will be set to 60
(12 turns approx) as opposed to 30 (6 turns approx). If you are in Haste then
the timer will be set at 30. When the timer hits 0 you will be inflicted with
Death.

The only way in which you can inflict or be inflicted with Death Sentence is
via the Enemy Skill of the same name, which can be learnt in the Cave of The
Gi from the Gi Spector and Sneaky Step, and also in Corral Valley from the
Boundfat. Using Death Sentence on a character that is inflicted with the
Status Death Sentence will not cure your character of that Status, in fact
there is no way to cure a character that has been placed in Death Sentence.

The Curse Ring will increase all of your stats considerably, but will also
put your character in Death Sentence at the beginning of each battle. This
can be easily overcome by using the Enemy Skill Death Force, or by using
Added Effect=Destruct. If you have Tifa equipped with either the Master Fist
or Powersoul then her attack power will be tripled or quadrupled,
respectively.

As with Slow-numb, setting the Battle Speed to slow will make Death Sentence
very dangerous, and as such it is recommended that you have the speed set to
halfway (minimum). Whilst in the Battle Square Death Sentence will not carry
over from one fight to the next (unlike Slow-numb). Although a Ribbon will
not protect you from Death, it will protect you from Death Sentence. If an
enemy is immune to Death then they are also immune to Death Sentence.

+-----------------+
|   {PARALYZED}   |  Visual: Character animation completely stops
+-----------------+

Paralyzed acts like Stop in almost every way, the two differences being that
you won't be able to act for roughly 2 rounds (as opposed to 7), and also
your Limit gauge won't fill up. There are 126 enemies that are immune to
Paralyze and 169 that are vulnerable.

 NOTE - Using Dazers on Ruby WEAPON is one of the best ways of defeating her.

There are very few attacks that can inflict Paralyze on your enemies.
Although Hades will inflict Paralyze when summoning him in battle, he will
not grant the Paralyze ability when paired with Added Effect.

+----------------+
|   {DARKNESS}   |  Visual: Character kneel down, starts flashing black
+----------------+

Darkness (aka Blind) will halve the accuracy of all physical attacks until
the ailment is cured or the battle ends. The only commands that are affected
are 'Attack', 'Morph', 'Deathblow', 'Mug', 'Slash-all', '2xCut' and '4xCut'.
Due to the fact that absolutely no enemies use the aforementioned commands,
inflicting Darkness upon an enemy is utterly pointless (rendering the Item
'Ink' obsolete).

The only way to inflict an enemy with a Status that acts as Darkness would is
to have a character us a Hyper in-battle. Before the character has been able
to cast the item, have the character inflicted with Confusion. If you are
lucky then the confused character will use the Hyper on the enemy inflicting
them with Fury, dropping their Hit% by 30%.

--E.09 E - Positive Statuses


  It's worth pointing out that if you're characters had the 'Resist' Status
active then they would also be immune to positive Statuses, which isn't a
good thing. To remove Resist you must cast DeSpell or White Wind.

DeBarrier will clear Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect and Shield whereas as DeSpell
will clear all of the above barriers plus Haste, Slow, Stop, Regen, Death
Force and Resist. Every one of Emerald WEAPON's attacks will have its own
'Status removing' property.

+-------------+
|   {HASTE}   |  Visual: Character's animation speed is doubled
+-------------+

Haste is probably the best positive Status in the game, and is the main
reason that you'll want to obtain the Enemy Skill Big Guard as soon as you
can. Making your ATB gauge fill at twice its normal rate, Haste really does
turn the tide in your favour, however certain other Statuses will then run
down more quickly, such as Regen, Death Sentence etc. Swings and roundabouts
I guess...

The Sprint Shoes are considered to be one of the best accessories in the game
(2nd to the Ribbon), and will set your characters up into auto-haste at the
beginning of each battle, with the added bonus of granting immunity to Slow.
They can be acquired in the Chocobo Square by winning 10 S Class matches in a
row, and at the Battle Square by talking to the woman at the bottom of the
stairs. Win 8 matches in the Arena then talk to her again.

Big Guard will grant Haste, Barrier and MBarrier to your party, and while
Barrier and MBarrier will drain over time, Haste will last for the entire
battle. You can obtain Big Guard by manipulating a Beach Plug found on the
beaches of the Gold Saucer Area after you've obtained the buggy. The earliest
point in the game that you can use Haste is by using Red XIII's 1-2 Limit
Break, Lunatic High. An immunity to Slow will also result in an immunity to
Haste.

+-------------+
|   {REGEN}   |  Visual: Character flashes orange
+-------------+

Regen is one of the best ways of healing yourself, as your HP will
continuously refill whilst under its effect. The Status will last roughly 10
turns, and is far more effective than using Cure3 in terms of MP consumption.
The rate is which your HP recovers works out to roughly 10% of your max HP
every turn.

The only way to cast Regen is through a Lv3 Restore, and the only way to
remove it is through DeSpell or Holy Torch (and also Emerald WEAPON's
attack - Emerald Beam). Casting Regen on an Undead enemy will *not* make
their health gradually deplete over time seeing as Regen is not of the
restorative Element (whereas moves such as Cure will harm the Undead).

If you were playing on the PS1 console, then you could make use of an
exploit. With Regen cast on all of your party members, open the lid of the
console. The battle will continue without crashing, although no enemy will
attack you, allowing you to regain full health uninterrupted.

+---------------+
|   {BARRIER}   |  Visual: Grey shield surrounds character, Barrier bar filled
+---------------+

Whilst under the influence of Barrier you will halve all physical attacks.
Every time the player gets hit and the Status takes effect a grey shield will
surround the character, as the effect wears off the shield will get smaller.
Barrier will last approximately 10 turns, and won't last as long if you are
under Haste, but will last twice as long if you are under Slow.

The Barrier 'gauge' is situated to the right of the character's name and is
the upper of the two bars; it's colour is red. Big Guard is the most
favourable way to set up Barrier, failing that you can use Wall.

+--------------+
|  {MBARRIER}  |  Visual: Pink shield surrounds character, MBarrier bar filled
+--------------+

Almost identical to Barrier, the only difference being that MBarrier will
halve all Magical attacks as opposed to physical attacks. MBarrier will last
as long as Barrier; 10 turns (approx). The main drawback to MBarrier is that
it will also halve the effects of healing spells such as Cure. As with
Barrier, the effect will last longer if the player is inflicted with Slow,
and won't last as long if the player is under Haste.

The Barrier 'gauge' is situated to the right of the character's name and is
the lower of the two bars; it's colour is yellow. Big Guard is the most
favourable way to set up MBarrier, failing that you can use Wall.

|   {REFLECT}   |  Visual: Green 'boomerang' appears in front of character
+---------------+

Reflect will make most magic spells bounce off of its target and reflected
back at the caster for up to 4 times. This can make healing quite tricky,
which is why most people avoid Reflect. If both parties have Reflect set-up
then the spell will bounce backwards and forwards 4 times, unless auto-
reflect is set-up in which case it will just bounce back once.

Reflect will last until the battle ends or until DeBarrier or DeSpell is
cast. The Mirage in the Shinra Mansion will always have auto-Reflect on, and
enemies that use Reflect are Jenova�LIFE, Gorkii and Proud Clod.

+--------------+
|   {SHIELD}   |  Visual: Brown shield envelops character
+--------------+

Costing a whopping 180MP, Shield isn't very often used. Lasting approximately
6 turns, Shield will nullify all 5 'physical' Elements (Cut, Punch, Shoot,
Shout and Hit) as well as the Restorative Element, and it will absorb all 9
'main' Elements (Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Poison, Gravity, Water, Wind
and Holy).

Shield will not defend against (non-elemental) physical attacks, nor will it
defend against Item damage (unless used through W-Item). This is a good thing
seeing as you'll still be able to heal yourself through the use of Items. No
enemies use Shield and the only way to remove Shield is through DeBarrier,
DeSpell and a Holy Torch.

You can obtain the Shield Materia in the Northern Cave, and you won't be able
to use it until it has reached Lv2 (which will require 10,000 AP). One of the
main problems with Shield is that there is no visible way of telling when it
has worn off, also you cannot pair it with All.

+----------------+
|   {PEERLESS}   |  Visual: Character flashes yellow
+----------------+

Peerless is basically the 'invincible' Status and can only be cast through 2
of Aeris's Limit Breaks:- 3-1 Planet Protector and Lv4 Great Gospel. Peerless
will last appropriately 6 turns and whilst under the Status you will also be
immune to all Status changes, whilst also locking any existing Statuses in
(similar to Resist). Peerless cannot be removed using DeSpell.

The only Status the you will be vulnerable to whilst under Peerless is
Imprisoned, however the only enemies that can inflict Imprisoned are Reno I,
Bottomswell and Jamar Armor, and it is unlikely you will have unlocked
Aeris's 3-1 Limit for the first two battles (although possible), and Jamar
Armor is on Disk 2.

--E.09 F - Supportive Statuses


  There are four Statuses that act slightly differently to the conventional
'Positive' and 'Negative' Statuses, these are Sadness, Fury, Manipulate and
Berserk.

+---------------+
|   {SADNESS}   |  Visual: Limit bar turns blue
+---------------+

The virtual opposite to Fury, Sadness will act in both positive and negative
ways. The bonus being that it will reduce all damage taken by 30%, the
downside being that it will reduce the speed your Limit gauge fills by half.
This is especially helpful for certain bosses such as the Midgar Zolom, or
Emerald WEAPON.

Sadness and Fury are the only two Statuses in the game that will remain with
your player after the battle has ended. You can self-inflict Sadness by using
a Tranquilizer (which will also cure Fury, but not simultaneously). If you
have a Ribbon equipped then you will be protected from Sadness during a
battle but you will still be able to inflict it upon yourself outside of
battle.

Self-inflicting Sadness is particularly useful once you have acquired Tifa's
Master Fist towards the end of Disk 2, as it will double her attack power.
Using White Wind or Angel Whisper will *not* cure you of Sadness/Fury, but
sleeping in an Inn will.

It is possible to inflict Sadness on an enemy by casting Confusion on a
player that is about to use a Tranquilizer, but seeing as an enemy has no
Limit bar, there would be absolutely no point in doing this as you would just
be aiding the enemy by giving them a defence boost.

+------------+
|   {FURY}   |  Visual: Limit bar turns red
+------------+

The opposite to Sadness, Fury will double the speed in which your Limit bar
fills, making Fury a very popular choice when it comes to Leveling up your
Limit Breaks. The flip-side being that all of your attacks will drop in
accuracy by 30%.

As with Sadness, you will not lose the Status once the battle has finished.
White Wind and Angel Whisper will not cure you of Fury, although Esuna will,
along with seeping in an Inn. A hyper will cure you of Sadness but will also
inflict you with Fury (but not simultaneously).

The only way to inflict an enemy with Fury is to cast Confu on a player, then
have that player select the command 'Hyper' before he/she is inflicted with
Confusion. If successful, the confused player will through the Hyper at an
enemy, dropping their accuracy by 30%. This is the only way to imitate the
Status 'Darkness' seeing as Darkness will have no effect whatsoever on the
enemy (due to poor programming).

You can still inflict yourself with Fury by using a Hyper whilst wearing a
Ribbon, provided that you do so outside of battle.

+------------------+
|   {MANIPULATE}   |  Visual: Enemy turns Cyan and faces the opposite way
+------------------+

Manipulate is easily one of the most useful Statuses in the game, and can
only be inflicted upon the enemy. Whilst the target is under Manipulate, the
caster will have (almost) total control of the enemies commands, and will
continue to do so until the target has been hit with a physical blow. 157
enemies are immune to Manipulate and 138 are vulnerable. The easiest way to
identify as to whether or not an enemy is immune or vulnerable is to take
note of the 'miss' sign that may or may not appear above the enemies head; If
it doesn't appear then the enemy is immune.

Regardless of how many commands the enemy has to use, you will only be able
to utilise the top three commands; because of this you will not be able to
learn White Wind from the Wind Wing in the Whirlwind Maze (unless you cast
Confusion on it). Using manipulated enemies to attack your players is the
best way to fill their Limits up; the Valron near Nibelheim (on the World
Map) is the ideal enemy for this as his Dive kick will deal damage equal to
1/4 of your max HP (Fury helps also).

You can first lay your hands on the Manipulate Materia when you first enter
the Gold Saucer on Disk 1 (Cait Sith will have it equipped on him). It is
only then will you be able to access certain Enemy Skills such as Big Guard
(learnt from the Beach Plug) and White Wind (learnt from the Zemzelett). The
other Enemy Skills that cannot be learned without the use of Manipulate are
Death Force, Angel Whisper and Dragon Force.

If the caster is wearing a HypnoCrown (found in the City of The Ancients)
then the succession rate of manipulating an enemy would be 100%, provided the
enemy wasn't immune. Otherwise, the higher the level difference between the
caster and its target, the higher the chance the caster has of manipulating,
which is why Cloud is always the best character to use Manipulate. An enemy
cannot be Manipulated if it is already inflicted with Paralyzed, Sleep, Stop,
Petrify or Resist (or is already Manipulated). Casting Paralyzed, Sleep,
Stop, Petrify or White Wind on the target will clear the Manipulate Status.

The enemy Skill 'Dragon Force' can be found on the Blue Dragons attack list,
however cannot be learned due to the fact that he cannot be inflicted with
Manipulate nor Confusion. The SOLDIER:2nd has a slightly amusing glitch; have
a Manipulated SOLDIER:2nd attack a fellow SOLDIER:2nd and the result will be
a stand-off between the two SOLDIERs until one of them dies!

The colour priority of Manipulate is at the bottom of the scale, so if
another Status was to be inflicted onto the manipulated enemy then the colour
would likely change to suit the new Status.

+---------------+
|   {BERSERK}   |  Visual: Character flashes red
+---------------+

Berserk can be a very useful Status to have inflicted upon your players.
Similar to Confusion, you will lose all control over the affected player, and
when their ATB gauge fills up they will use the 'Attack' command
automatically. The biggest difference being that the 'Berserked' player will
only attack the enemy (as opposed to potentially harming your teammates), and
their attack power will increase by 50%.

The Status will not be cured by a hit from a physical blow as Confusion is;
it will last until it is cured or until the battle ends. There are 127
enemies that are immune to Berserk, and 168 that are vulnerable. Although
inflicting an enemy with Berserk may sound like a bad idea, Berserk will
actually limit the amount of attacks that an enemy will use, and can render
some powerful foes not-so-powerful. If an enemy doesn't have a specific
attack to use whilst Berserked then they won't be able to attack you at all!
Also, an enemy that hits for 150% of his normal attack power could help with
Limit Break Leveling.

The Fury Ring can be bought from Gongaga Village and will place your
character in Auto-Berserk. This strategy can be very advantageous when placed
on your strongest attacker, such as Barret or Vincent; Vincent's Limit Breaks
work very similar to Berserk, also. Whilst Vincent is in his transformed
state he will be immune to the Berserk Status. The Fury Ring is best used
when you are undergoing Yuffie's Sidequest in Wutai.

Lastly, whilst a character is inflicted with Berserk they can also hit with a
Critical Strike (contrary to common mis-conception), which can cause
incredible damage, and in the right circumstances can even cause Damage
Overflow. If you have the Added Cut and Master Command Materia, then you
could equip them together along with Berserk to have the inflicted player hit
the enemy twice every turn!

--E.09 G - Unlisted Statuses


  There are 9 Statuses that are not listed on the 'Status' menu:

 - POSITIVE:

~Death Force~   ~Resist~   ~7777 Fever~   ~Lucky Girl~   ~Back Row~   ~Defend~

 - NEGATIVE:

~Imprisoned~   ~Seizure/Dual~   ~K.O~

Some of these unlisted Statuses would be better described as 'conditions', as
they act more passively than the main 'listed' 24 Statuses. Note that using
DeSpell will remove Resist and Death Force, whereas using a Holy Torch will
not. Resist will not protect you from any of the unlisted Statuses.

+-------------------+
|   {DEATH FORCE}   |
+-------------------+

Whilst under the influence of Death Force your character will gain immunity
to Death until the end of battle, or until DeSpell or White Wind is cast on
the character, or the character is K.O'd. If a move that inflicts Death is
cast upon the player under Death Force, the player will still have Death
immunity for the remainder of the battle. If Death Sentence is cast on a
player immune to Death then the countdown will continue to run down, but the
player will not die once the countdown has finished. A Holy Torch will not
remove Death Force.

Death Force can be cast using the Enemy Skill of the same name, and can be
learned from the enemy Adamantaimai which can be found lurking on the shores
of Wutai. The Adamantaimai will never use Death Force, and the only way for
you to learn it is through use of the Manipulate Materia. To utilise Death
Force properly all three players must have learned the Enemy Skill, otherwise
a player that has used Death Force on themselves would lose their immunity to
Death should they then cast Death Force on another player. Death Force costs
3MP to use.

There are only two moves in the game that override the Death immunity, and
both can be found on Cait Sith's 'Slots' Limit Break - Death Joker and Game
Over. The only times that you'll need to use Death Force is against the Joker
in Gold Saucer Area, the Tonberry in the Battle Square, and up in the North
Crater: Parasite, Master Tonberry, Gargoyle, Allemagne, Scissors, Christopher
and Death Dealer. Death Force is also very useful if you are using the Curse
Ring.

+--------------+
|   {RESIST}   |
+--------------+

Resist will protect you from all Statuses, good or bad, and can be used via a
level 3 Heal Materia (costing 150MP), or from a 'Vaccine'. Resist will also
lock in any current Status that you currently have applied on you, excluding
Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect, Shield, Regen and Peerless. This can be a very
bad thing seeing as Resist will last either until the end of battle, or until
it is cured which can be done using either by using White Wind or DeSpell.
Using a Holy Torch will *not* remove Resist.

Resist can be disastrous in the Battle Arena, as it will *not* protect you
from Status changes received from handicaps. Resist will instead lock those
Statuses in place, making it potentially very difficult to remove the
inflicted Statuses once they have been applied.

+------------------+
|   {7777 FEVER}   |
+------------------+

 NOTE - This is basically a condensed down version of section E.18 A.

7777 Fever, or All Lucky 7's is an easter egg that occurs when a character's
current HP falls on precisely 7777. When this happens, the character will
enter into a Berserk-like Status where they will begin attacking the enemy
non-stop for 7777 HP worth of damage each attack. After 64 attacks the buff
will end, resulting in a total of 497,728 HP worth of damage. The 'attack' is
considered to be one move, and the enemy will not be able to use their
commands until you have finished attacking.

If more than one player enters into 7777 Fever in a battle, then the result
would *not* be an additional 64 attacks; All Lucky 7's can only yield a
maximum of 64 attacks per battle, regardless of whether the attacks come from
just one or all three players. You will regain normal control of your
characters once they have finished attacking, the only difference being they
will now heal for 7777 HP every time a healing move/item is used (Potions,
Phoenix Downs etc.). Also, every time they hit the enemy they will do so for
7777 HP worth of damage. These effects will last until the battle ends or the
characters HP changes. Once the battle has finished, the affected player's HP
will be reduced to 1, restricting 7777 Fever's re-usage.

Whilst inflicted with 7777 Fever, the character's name will flash the same
rainbow colours as the 'Limit' command, and the message bar will turn the
same shade of purple as if a Limit Break was being used. Similarly, as soon
as the player enters into the 7777 state, they will begin attacking without
delay. Critical hits will never be used and all Elemental and Status changing
properties will be suspended. There are only a few enemies that will be left
standing once the bombardment of attacks have finished, namely some of the
WEAPONs.

It is possible for an enemy to enter into 7777 Fever, if this happens then
consider escaping from the battle as your whole team would be in danger of
being wiped out. If a player enters into 7777 Fever whilst Poisoned, then the
result would be 7777 HP worth of damage (killing  them instantly), seeing as
the damage taken from Poison would count as self-inflicted damage. Also,
during the very final battle with Sephiroth, 7777 Fever is disabled. This is
the only battle in the game where this will occur.

 METHODS OF ENABLING 7777 FEVER:

1.) If the last two digits of your HP fall on 77 then you can use Hi-Potions
    and Potions to bring your HP to 7777. One method of doing this would be
    to equip the following:

 A  Manipulate, Transform (or 2x 'Shrivel') and Goblin Punch Enemy Skill x 2.
    Don't equip Mega-All or Slash-All, don't have your Limit Breaks filled up
    and don't have the player with Manipulate equipped with Transform or
    Enemy Skill. Speed up the Battle Speed all the way.

    Enter into a battle and immediately Manipulate the enemy, killing off any
    of its companions. Cast Haste (or Big Guard) and then have all two of
    your players inflicted with Small (using Shrivels or the Transform
    Materia). Goblin Punch will always inflict 8 HP, so long as your players
    are the same level as each other, so you can keep using that until the
    last two digits are lower than 85 but above 77; if they fall on 85
    exactly then you can use Goblin Punch one more time to bring it down to
    exactly 77. Otherwise, you can have your players attack one another for
    1HP of damage until their HP lands on precisely 77.

 B  Another method of doing this would be to equip the Cat's Bell, which will
    recover 2HP per step. You would then need to run around until the last
    three digits fall on 154, 354, 554, 754 or 954. You would then need to
    cast Demi2 or Laser to reduce your HP by half, resulting in the final 2
    digits being 77.

 C  If you find that the last two digits of your *Max* MP are sitting on 77,
    then you can quickly swap HP<->MP on and off again to bring the last two
    digits of your HP to 77.

2.) Whilst fighting Emerald WEAPON, it will occasionally use the move AIRE
    TAM (Materia spelt backwards). This move will inflict 1111 HP worth of
    damage for every piece of Materia you have equipped on one character. The
    damage does not stack; if Yuffie had 3 pieces and Cid had 5 pieces, the
    resulting damage would *not* be 8888 HP. Yuffie would receive 3333 HP and
    Cid would receive 5555 HP.

    Go into battle with just 2 pieces of Materia equipped on one of your
    characters, making sure that one of the pieces is HP Plus, as to bring
    your Max HP to 9999. Making sure that the player's HP is always topped to
    the max, when Emerald uses Aire Tam Storm the resulting damage would be
    2222, bringing the player's HP down to bang on 7777, activating 7777
    Fever.

3.) Every time you escape from battle (using L1&R1), or by using the Exit
    Materia), Chocobuckle will gain 1HP worth of damage. If you were to
    escape from a total of 2222 battles then Chocobuckle will deal 2222 HP
    worth of damage with every hit, making it possible to bring your Max HP
    of 9999 down to 7777.

5.) You can manipulate your Max HP stats by using Materia that increases and
    decreases your Max HP, such as Summons, Magic Materia, HP Plus Materia
    etc. You can try to figure out using trial and error a way to have your
    Max HP sitting xx77. This can be very difficult and long-winded to do....

    UNLESS

    You have a walkthrough!!!! See section E.18 A - Lucky 7's for a quick and
    easy reference on how to modify your HP accordingly to achieve 7777 Fever
    using Magic and Summon Materia. All credit for that section goes to James
    Baxter.

+------------------+
|   {LUCKY GIRL}   |
+------------------+

Lucky Girl is activated by using Cait Sith's level 2 Limit Break 'Slots';
lining up 3 Hearts will have Cait Sith inflict the party with Lucky Girl.
Whilst under the Status, all characters will hit for Critical Hits until the
battle ends, or until the character is K.O'd.

Use QSI Link [Slots] to find out how to manipulate the reels to land on 3
Hearts.

+----------------+
|   {BACK ROW}   |
+----------------+

To place your characters in the back row you must go into the Menus, select
'Order' and then double-press confirm to move your characters from the front
row to the back and vice-versa. A character positioned to the right hand side
is placed in the back row. You can also arrange your characters position mid-
battle by pressing left on the D-pad, then confirm.

Whilst placed in the back row, characters will deliver and receive half
damage from all physical attacks, whilst characters in the front row will
deliver and receive normal damage. Magic remains completely unaffected by
which row you are in. The enemy will also conform to row patterns, and an
enemy that is in the back row will receive 1/4 damage from one of your
characters that is placed in the back row. If the enemy has three rows, then
all enemies in the back two rows will be considered in the back row. If a
character has the Cover Materia equipped, then they will still receive half
damage even if they are defending someone in the front row.

For the start of the game I recommend keeping all of your characters in the
front row, seeing the extra damage incurred will help towards Leveling up
your Limit Breaks early on. There are four characters who yield long ranged
weapons - Yuffie, Vincent, Barret and Red XIII. Whilst equipped with a long
ranged weapon, a character will do the same damage in the back row as they
would in the front, but still receive half damage from physical attacks. The
Long Range Materia also has the same effect of equipping a long ranged weapon.

There are certain creatures that are considered to be 'flying', such as
Hundred Gunner, Zuu, or Bottomswell. These creatures will not be able to be
hit by physical attacks, unless the attacker is long-ranged. The Hell Rider
VR2 uses a move called Electromag which will swap your characters 'row'
positions around. Also, When you fight the boss Motor Ball (at the end of the
Midgar Highway) your rows will be reversed.

Uncommonly you will find that the 'column' formation of the enemy will result
in you being unable to attack an enemy that is in the back row, although this
occurs infrequently.

+--------------+
|   {DEFEND}   |
+--------------+

By pressing right on the D-pad during battle followed by confirm, you can opt
to 'defend' for one turn, halving all physical damage taken during that time.
If you were placed in the back row then you would receive 1/4 damage. Do not
opt to Defend if you are Poisoned; the Poison damage would take you out of
Defend. You will not receive 1/2 Poison damage.

+------------------+
|   {IMPRISONED}   |
+------------------+

Imprisoned is one of the worst Statuses in the game, and luckily there are
only 3 attacks in the whole game that can Imprison a character; all being
Bosses. Whilst inflicted with Imprisoned, the character will no longer be
able to act, nor will they be flagged as a target, and instead a new enemy
will take the characters place. The new enemy must then be killed, usually by
a single physical blow, in order to free the inflicted character.

An Imprisoned player is flagged as dead, so if all three players become
Imprisoned then it's Game Over. Like Petrify, your current HP is maintained.

The first of the three bosses that use Imprisoned is Reno I fought at the top
of the Support Tower in Sector 7. He will use an attack called Pyramid, which
will cast a Pyramid like structure around the inflicted player. A single
physical blow to the pyramid will cure the player.

The second enemy to use Imprisoned is Bottomswell, although he will also
inflict Seizure using an attack called Waterball. More details on Seizure
below. The Waterball must attacked with a magical attack in order to destroy
it.

The last Boss to use Imprisoned is Carry Armor in Junon's Underwater Reactor.
Both the Left Arm and the Right Arm can imprison a character using their move
Arm Grab, and then when Carry Armor uses either arm to attack, the Imprisoned
character will also take damage. If two players are Imprisoned and the third
is killed, then it'll be Game Over. The only way to free the character is to
kill the arm holding it, or if the afflicted character is killed.

+---------------+
|   {SEIZURE}   |
+---------------+

Seizure basically acts as a 'reversed-Regen', slowly draining your HP over
time at the exact same rate as Regen; casting Regen on a character under the
effect of Seizure would completely negate both effects.

Thankfully only one enemy in the game uses Seizure, and that is Bottomswell
which is fought on your first visit to Junon. Using an attack called
Waterball, Bottomswell will also inflict Imprisoned on you, and unlike Reno's
'Pyramid', you must free the afflicted character with a magical attack as
opposed to a physical attack.

'Dual' is a dummied out Status and serves no purpose whatsoever, although
using hacking devices Dual will sometimes be the Status name displayed in
place of Seizure.

+-----------+
|   {K.O}   |
+-----------+

If a player's HP runs down to 0, or if a player is inflicted with Death, then
they will be met by the condition 'K.O'. Whilst K.O'd, the character will lie
dead on the ground, their HP bar will be red and their ATB gauge will never
fill up. Also, the 'dead' flag will be checked for that character; if all
characters are flagged as dead then you will be met with a Game Over screen.
When a character is K.O'd, their Limit gauge will be reset to 0.

The only ways to heal someone from K.O is to use a Phoenix Down, Life, Life2,
Phoenix, Angel Whisper or sleeping in an Inn. K.O is one of three Statuses
that will carry over from battle to battle, the other two being Fury and
Sadness. If a character is not cured of K.O before a battle has finished then
they will not gain any EXP or AP.

 NOTE - Being K.O'd and being dead are two very different things. That's why
        you can't simply use a Phoenix Down on certain characters that die
        within the game...

--E.10 A - Shinra Mansion


  Vincent Valentine is one of two 'hidden' characters that can be recruited,
along with Yuffie Kisaragi. See section E.07 for details on how to recruit
Yuffie. Vincent can be recruited from the point at which you visit Nibelheim
in Disk 1, and can be obtained at any point during the game thereafter. You
will unlock the 'Won't You Be My Valentine?' Trophy when you do recruit him.

Before anything else, make sure to have protection from Confusion when
navigating the Shinra Mansion (Peace Ring). Section D1.15 B will give you the
full walkthrough, whereas this section will only cover the recruiting process.

In order to recruit Vincent, you must open a safe located on the western wing
of the second floor. To work out the combination, you must first find the
note that can be found on the first floor in the south eastern room. The four
clues are as follows:

Clue 1: 'The lid of the box with the most oxygen.'

         On the second floor in the western-most room you will find a
         treasure chest. Examine it (after opening it) to receive the
         first combination.                                         - Right 36

Clue 2: 'Behind the ivory's short of tea and ray.'

         On the first floor in the western-most room you will find a grand
         piano. On the floor behind it you will find second combination.
                                                                    -  Left 10

Clue 3: 'The creek in the floor board near the chair on the second floor...
         Then to the left five steps, up nine steps, left two steps and up six
         steps.'

         On the second floor eastern wing. Search the corridor, you'll find
         the clue in a spot that is almost in-line with the chest (overhead
         perspective).                                              - Right 59

Clue 4: 'The fourth has been written in invisible ink....'

         The fourth combination is hidden in plain sight. When selecting
         which clue to read, bring the finger cursor down to the fourth line
         to reveal the fourth combination.                          - Right 97

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you're ready, save the game and head up to the second floor western wing
to try the safe combo. Be warned, when you have successfully opened the safe
you will be met with a Boss!

 NOTES - Left 10 means that you have to go left to the number 10, and *not*
         left 10 spaces from 36 (to 26).

       - If you accidentally went past the number required then you will have
         failed and you'll have to try again.

--E.10 B - Lost Number


  Before fighting this Boss, equip Added Effect with either Time or
Choco/Mog, as he is vulnerable to Stop. Equip Elemental defence from
Lightning, Earth and/or Poison also.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| If you are fighting Lost Number on your first     ------Lv: | 35---------- |
| visit to Nibelheim, then you'll be in for a bit   ------HP: | 7000-------- |
| of a challenge, as he is quite a high level. Be   ------MP: | 300--------- |
| sure to cast Big Guard first and foremost, then   -----EXP: | 2000-------- |
| just keep spamming heavy hitting magic moves,     ------AP: | 80---------- |
| such as Beta.                                     -----GIL: | 2000-------- |
|                                                   ----DROP: | Cosmo Memory |
| Once his health has dropped below 50%, one half   -NULLIFY: | GRV--------- |
| of him will die. If the last move that hit him                             |
| was a magical attack, then his purple half will die, leaving just his red  |
| half. This red half will be weak against physical attacks but strong       |
| against magical attacks, and is the side that we wish to be left with. If  |
| you had last hit him with a physical attack as his health dropped below    |
| 50%, then you will be left his purple side which is weak against magical   |
| attacks but strong against physical attacks. This half is more challenging |
| than the red half.                                                         |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

When he is finished, you'll be rewarded with the 'Key to the Basement', which
you'll have to manually pick up from within the safe itself. You'll also be
able to pick up the Odin Materia on the floor to the left of the safe, and
you'll receive the Cosmo Memory after battle has finished, which is Red
XIII's Lv 4 Limit Break Manual.

������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.10 C - Vincent


  Now that you have the key to the basement, you can unlock Vincent. Head
down into the basement, and before heading into the laboratory, head north
into the previously locked room. Here you will find a coffin. Interact with
it, then choose to talk about Sephiroth when prompted.

When you regain control of Cloud, interact with the coffin a second time and
select 'Who are you?' when prompted. After you have named Vincent, you will
learn about a woman named Lucrecia, and a little bit about Vincent's past.
When he resides back into his coffin, simply head towards the staircase
leading to the mansion and Vincent will decide to join you.

Vincent's starting level is worked out accordingly: Average party level + 3.

Very little is known about Vincent's past, if you wish to learn more about
him the you must wait until Disk 2 when you have obtained either the
Submarine, or a Green/Black/Gold Chocobo. You can then visit Lucrecia's cave
situated in North Corel and Gongaga.

Vincent is quite a powerful character to have on your team, as all of his
weapons are long-ranged. Two of his weapons have 255 Attack%, which means
they will hardly ever miss. This is especially handy when using Deathblow.
These weapons are the Sniper CR and the Long Barrel R.

  When you embark on Yuffie's sidequest, she will steal up to 48 pieces of
Materia from you. If you happen to be holding more than 48 pieces of Materia,
then you will be left with some pieces to play with.

The order of Materia that she will take are as follows:

  The foreman to the left of the entrance will sell the following: (ALL DISKS)

| Diamond Bangle | 3200 gil  |  You'll be able to find Bone Village on the

|         Potion |   50 gil  |  you'll first be able to visit the place once
|      Hi-Potion |  300 gil  |  you have obtained the Tiny Bronco. Even
|          Ether | 1500 gil  |  though the game will not demand that you
|   Phoenix Down |  300 gil  |  visit Bone Village until after the Temple of
|       Antidote |   80 gil  |  The Ancients sequence, you should still visit
|       Eye Drop |   50 gil  |  the place as soon as possible in order to
|          Hyper |  100 gil  |  obtain the Diamond Bangle and the Rune Armlet.
|   Tranquilizer |  100 gil  |  The Rune Armlet is the only double growth
|           Tent |  500 gil  |  armour in the game.
|________________|___________|

Just outside of Bone Village you'll be able to encounter the Vlakorados,
which is a red dragon of sorts. He has 33,333 HP and can take a very long
time to kill. The main incentive to fight them is the fact that they carry
the Carob Nut, which is an essential item for Chocobo breeding. Note that you
will not encounter enemies in the forest area surrounding Bone Village itself.

Past Bone Village you will find the Sleeping Forest. Every so often you will
notice a red orb floating upwards. Stand at the base of a tree and
continually press confirm to eventually obtain the red orb - the Kjata
Materia.

If you were to head north you would encounter a never ending screen-loop. The
only way to pass through is by using the Lunar Harp, and to do that you must
partake in the digging mini game.

If you reckon you can do a better job of the artwork than myself, then by all
means do so! Send your ASCII Art to DynamixDJ@writeme.com, and if I decide to
replace my map with yours I will be sure to give all credit where it is
due.

--E.12 C - How The Game Works


  Firstly, talk to the foreman. He will be sitting to the left of the
entrance near dig spot 3 (you can also buy the aforementioned armour here).
You will have the option of selecting Lunar Harp, Good Treasure or Normal
Treasure. Once you have selected your choice, you will be allowed to place up
to 5 workers in locations of your choice. Each worker will cost 100 gil.

Once you have placed your workers, select 'done' to detonate a bomb. Then,
each worker will face the direction of the chosen treasure. Using the map
above, you will then be able to triangulate the position of the treasure.
Once you have confirmed which position you would like to dig, you will spend
the night at Bone Village (also restoring you HP/MP). The treasure can then
be collected from the chest to the left of the entrance.

The interesting thing about the digging game is that you don't actually have
to place down any workers! So long as you know the locating of each treasure,
you can simply select 'done' before placing down any workers. The bonus to
doing this will be that you can select any search spot, regardless of which
treasure type you had selected i.e. you could select 'Normal Treasure', then
search spot 8 and you'll still receive the Lunar Harp, provided that you
hadn't placed any workers (and you hadn't already obtained it).

Using this knowledge, you could use the digging game to infinitely farm
Ethers on Spot 6 for free!


������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.12 D - Glitches


  There are 3 known 'bugs' related to the Bone Village digging game:

1) Phoenix. If you failed to obtain the Phoenix Materia from the Fort Condor
   mission then you will be able to dig one up from Bone Village (Spot 5). It
   is possible to obtain two un-mastered Phoenix Materias by simply not
   collecting the Materia after the Fort Condor Huge Materia quest, until
   after you've dug one up. You'll still be able to grab the Huge Materia,
   and you'll still be able to return to the shack to grab the Materia at any
   point in the game. Provided the Phoenix is not in your Materia inventory,
   you'll be able to dig it up on Disk 3.

2) Kjata. Under normal circumstances, when you attempt to pick up a piece of
   Materia with a full inventory, the game will not allow you to pick up that
   piece until you have either discarded or sold some of your Materia. Kjata,
   however, is bugged. If you attempted to pick it up with a full Materia
   inventory, the game will still allow you to remove it from the field
   without adding it to your inventory, thereby losing it permanently.

3) Steal Materia/Catastrophe. Written into the games coding is the ability to
   dig up a Steal Materia and Barret's Lv 4 Limit Manual, Catastrophe. Seeing
   as neither item is missable, it is suspected that these items were placed
   as test dummies. There have been claims that the Steal Materia has been
   dug up on a PSX version, although these claims may be untrue.

--E.13 A - About Ultimate Weapons


  All ultimate weapons have a few things in common:

1) They will all have 0 growth, excluding Aeris's.

2) The all have 8 paired Materia slots, excluding Aeris's.

3) They will all have a special quality, gaining additional power when a
   certain condition is met.

Due to the fact that your Materia will never level up whilst equipped to your
ultimate weapons, it is fair to say that they are not the most favourable of
weapons to use, although there aren't many weapons that surpass them in the
way of strength. The only weapons that can match up to these Ultimate Weapons
are:

 - Barret's Max Ray           - Attack = 97  (found in Midgar Sector 8)
 - Cloud's Ragnarok           - Attack = 97  (prize for defeating Proud Clod)
 - Cid's Flayer               - Attack = 100 (prize in Speed Square)

None of the above weapons come with a "damage modifier" however, and as such
cannot compete with the damage output of the Ultimate Weapons.

The most used Ultimate Weapon has to be the Conformer for Yuffie. This is
because it will deal regular damage whilst using Morph (as opposed to 12.5%
normal damage). This is particularly useful when it comes to farming valuable
items such as Sources and Elixirs.

The following characters power will be increased when certain conditions are
met:

  Cloud     - Gains more power the higher his current HP is.
  Barret    - Gains more power the more AP is equipped to his weapon.
  Tifa      - Gains more power the higher her Limit bar is filled.
  Aeris     - Gains more power when her allies are K.O'd
  Red XIII  - Gains more power the higher his current MP is.
  Yuffie    - Gains more power the higher the enemies level is.
  Cait Sith - Gains more power the higher his current HP is.
  Vincent   - Gains more power with every enemy he kills.
  Cid       - Gains more power the higher his current MP is.

Here is a chart depicting how powerful each weapon will become whilst
influenced by its Power-Up condition:

| Vincent   | N/A        | 768 Kills  | 2816 Kills | 4864 Kills | 6912 Kills |
|-----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------|
| Cid       | MP at 1/6  | MP at 1/3  | MP at 2/3  | MP at full | N/A        |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
 *If Tifa's Limit level was set to level 4.

 NOTES - For every weapon listed below, I have modified the damage output
         formula for simplicity. When calculating the "actual" damage output,
         please refer to the original formula. By default, Power is 16
         (16 = 1x normal damage, 32 = 2x normal damage, etc).

       - All of the Ultimate Weapons excluding Aeris and Yuffie's can cause
         damage overflow. Use QSI Link [DAMAGE OVERFLOW GLITCH] for more info.

|     Damage = [48 * CURRENT HP / MAX HP + 1 / 16] * DAMAGE                  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Original formula:

Power = [(3 * POWER * CURRENT HP) / MAX HP] + 1

The Ultima Weapon is considered to be one of the strongest weapons in the
game. When Cloud's HP is in critical the Sword will glow dark blue, and when
Cloud's HP is full it will glow a bright white.

The Ultima Weapon is required in order to partake in the optional battle at
the Battle Square, and as such you cannot obtain the Final Attack Materia
(prize for optional battle) before obtaining the Ultima Weapon.

Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon, the HP Shout, shares the same Power-Up
properties as the Ultima Weapon.

| - The chest will *ONLY* appear if Barret is in your party.                 |
| - Barret will deliver 3x damage for having 500,000 AP equipped on his      |
|   weapon, 6x for having 1 million AP and 9x for having 1.5 million AP.     |
|                                                                            |
|     Damage = [TOTAL AP ON WEAPON / 10,000 + 1 / 16] * DAMAGE               |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Original formula:

Power = [POWER * [TOTAL AP ON WEAPON / 10000] / 16] + 1

The more AP the weapon has equipped on it, the higher its attack power will
be. Master Magic, Master Command, Master Summon, Enemy Skill and Underwater
do not contribute to the total. A piece of Materia will not store any more AP
once it has been mastered.

If Barret's Strength was 255 along with being Lv 99, you could equip 3 x
mastered Knights of The Round Materias to send Barret's damage counter high
enough to overflow against Emerald, killing it in one-hit (also using 4 Hero
Drinks, Berserk & Critical).

| - Item cannot be thrown.                                                   |
| - If Tifa's Limit is set to Level 4, then she would deliver 4x damage with |
|   a full Limit gauge, 2x damage with a half filled gauge, and 1x damage    |
|   with a 1/4 filled gauge. At Limit Level 2 she would 1x damage with a 1/2 |
|   filled gauge.                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|     Damage = [LIMIT LEVEL * LIMIT BAR UNITS / 16 + 1 / 16] * DAMAGE        |
|     (A Full Limit bar would be 255 units, a half filled bar would be 127)  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Original formula:

Power = [POWER * [ LIMIT LEVEL * LIMIT BAR UNITS / 16] / 16] + 1

Anything less than a 1/4 filled bar would deal less than normal damage, and
an empty Limit bar could deal as little as 200 HP.

Due to this peculiar formula, most people stay well away from the weapon,
favouring other weapons such as the God Hand (which has 255 Attack%) or
Master Fist (which gains damage when under status afflictions).

Alternatively, you could equip Tifa with Added Cut and Deathblow, let her
gauge fill up and never use her Limit.

If you enter the ITEM hut in the Wall Market with Cid in your party then a
slightly amusing additional scene will play out.

The Princess Guard is unique for 4 reasons - It is the only Ultimate Weapon
available on Disk 1, it is the only Ultimate Weapon to have 7 slots as
opposed to 8, it is the only Ultimate Weapon to have normal growth, and it is
the only ultimate weapon other than the Conformer that cannot cause damage
overflow.

It's Power-Up effect is identical to that of Cloud's Yoshiyuki - It will
double in attack power if one ally is dead and it will triple in attack power
if two allies are dead.

|     Damage = [AVERAGE TARGETED ENEMY'S LEVEL / 16] * DAMAGE                |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Original formula:

Power = [AVERAGE LEVEL OF ALL ENEMIES TARGETED BY ATTACK]

The average enemy level takes into account every enemy that is targeted by
the attack. If Yuffie is only targeting one enemy, then only that enemy's
level is taken into account.

The Conformer is one of the best weapons on the game seeing as it will
completely ignore the reduced damage effects of Morph, hitting each opponent
for 100% damage (as opposed to 12.5%). This is particularly useful for the
Sunken Gelnika, as you can Morph every enemy in there into Sources.

If you were to attack an ally whilst wielding the Conformer, then you would
hit your comrades for 1HP of damage, although no damage counter would be
displayed. You will still be able to negate the effects of Sleep and
Confusion.

Original formula:

Power = [Power * [Vincent's Kills / 128] / 16] + 10

Due to the programming of Vincent's Death Penalty, it is possible to active
the overflow glitch. You can one-hit Emerald by reaching an absurd amount of
kills (16,896), raising Vincent's Strength up to 255 and then use four Hero
Drinks, Berserk and land a critical hit (given the way in which "Random
Variation" is worked out, you may still fail to overflow this way; 18,048
kills is needed to guarantee overflow every time with this set-up).

Every 128 kills Vincent gets his damage multiplier increases by 1. With 0
kills, Vincent's damage output will be 62.5% of it's normal attack power.

Note to reader: Since writing this section, I have done an incredible amount
of Chocobo related tests, namely involving RNG manipulation. Eventually, the
entire Chocobo mechanics within my guide (including the as-you-play breeding
guide) is going to be getting a complete overhaul.

I have become so adept with all things Chocobo-related, that I was recently
dubbed on a forum as "The Chocobo Whisperer". Lol

--E.14 A - About Chocobo Breeding
������������������������������������������������������������������������������


  Welcome to perhaps the longest side-quest of Final Fantasy VII - Chocobo
Breeding. If you wish to skip straight to the breeding process, then jump
down to section E.10 F. Otherwise, I recommend taking the time to familiarise
yourself with the mechanics of breeding, especially if you are new to the
game.

You won't be able to begin the Chocobo Breeding process until you have
obtained the Highwind, and the Gold Saucer has re-opened (after the
Lifestream events) on Disk 2. While the Chocobo Breeding side-quest is
optional, there are some great benefits to partaking in it:

 1.) Chocobos act as a mode of transport, and breeding 'Special' Chocobos
     will enable you to access secret locations on the World Map, such as the
     'Materia Caves' (see section E.15), the Ancient Forest and Lucrecia's
     Cave.

 2.) Breeding Special Chocobos will result in better racing Chocobos to
     race at the Chocobo Square at the Gold Saucer. Having a better racing
     Chocobos will mean that you will be able to compete in the higher
     classes, and the higher the class the greater the reward!

 3.) The Battle Square at the Gold Saucer yields the greatest prizes of all
     Gold Saucer Prizes, and in order to compete in the Arena you must pay 10
     GP per battle. The only way to accumulate a sufficient amount of GP is
     via Chocobo racing.

 4.) The WEAPON super bosses are extremely difficult to defeat, and the
     Materia that you can acquire from the Materia Caves will probably mean
     the difference between success and defeat.

There are 4 'Special Chocobos' that you can breed:

 MOUNTAIN CHOCOBO (Green):

    A Mountain Chocobo can soar across all mountains, and can be used to
    access the Materia Cave in Wutai.

 RIVER CHOCOBO (Blue):

    A River Chocobo can cross shallow water and rivers (the Buggy and the
    Tiny Bronco combined), and can be used to access the Materia Cave near
    Mideel.

 MOUNTAIN-AND-RIVER CHOCOBO (Black):

    A Mountain and River Chocobo is the second best Chocobo available, and
    can be used to access the Materia Cave near Corel.

 OCEAN CHOCOBO (Gold):

    An Ocean Chocobo can go pretty much anywhere on the map except for
    underwater, and can be used to access the Materia Cave on Round Island
    (unmarked island located at the north-eastern corner of the map).

 NOTE - Chocobo Breeding will cost in the region of 500,000 gil, and will take
        approximately 3 1/2 hours to complete.


������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.14 B - How To Catch A Chocobo

To catch a Chocobo you must first equip the Chocobo Lure Materia. You must
then locate a set of Chocobo tracks that can be found in various places
scattered across the World Map. Run around until you engage in a battle, you
may not encounter a Chocobo on your first battle; the higher the level of the
Chocobo Lure Materia the higher the chance of you encountering a Chocobo.

You'll know if you have encountered a Chocobo from the music that plays.
Whilst in-battle, the Chocobo must not be hit, or it'll run away. After
roughly 2 turns, the Chocobo will run away unless you have defeated all of
the surrounding enemies. You can stall the Chocobos departure by feeding them
Greens, the better the quality of the Green the longer they'll stay. Greens
can be bought from the Chocobo Ranch or from the Chocobo Sage. Once the
battle has finished and you have successfully caught the Chocobo, you will
find that you will be riding on the back of one when you return to the Word
Map.

Whilst traversing on a Chocobo, random battle encounters will be disabled.
Also, equipping a level 1 Chocobo Lure Materia will give you a 75% chance of
encountering a Chocobo near the Chocobo Ranch, 50% near Junon and 25%
everywhere else. A level 3 or 4 Chocobo Lure will give you 100% chance at the
Chocobo Ranch and Junon, 50% everywhere else. 2x level 3/mastered Chocobo
Lures would tack to give you 100% encounter rate on any Chocobo track.


������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.14 C - The Chocobo Ranch

The Chocobo Ranch can be located south west of Midgar, and can first be
visited early on in Disk 1. During your visit you will need to buy the
Chocobo Lure Materia for 2000 gil, then you will need to catch a Chocobo in
order to cross the Marsh that is home to the Midgar Zolom. Although you can
catch Chocobos at this early stage in the game, you will not be able to store
them at the Chocobo Ranch until you reach Disk 2; You will find that when you
disembark from a Chocobo you will be prompted to either 'send it back to the
stables' or 'turn it loose'. On Disk 1 this option will not be available.

When you send a Chocobo back to the stables, it will be kept in the outside
pen. The maximum you can store there is 4, when a fifth one is caught the
first one will be let go. To move your Chocobos into the stables you must
first rent the stables from Chocobo Bill who can be found in the Inn to the
left of the ranch. Each stable will cost 10,000 gil to rent, and there are a
total of 6 to rent.

Once you have rented at least one stable, you can talk to Chocobo Billy in
the ranch to be prompted to select from the following:

'Buy'                  - Buy various Nuts and Greens
'Get some information' - Learn some more about Chocobos
'Moving Chocobos'    - Move your Chocobos from the pen to the stable
'Feeding Chocobos'   - Feed your Chocobos Greens to improve their racing stats
'Mating Chocobos'    - Mate a female and a male Chocobo together
'Releasing Chocobos' - Release a Chocobo back into the wild
'Riding Chocobos'    - Ride a Chocobo you've caught around the World Map

 NOTE - A lot of the names for the Greens and the Nuts are mis-spelt whilst
        navigating through the available options at the Chocobo Ranch.

Select 'Moving Chocobos' to bring a Chocobo you've caught into the stables.
At this point, a Chocobos gender will be determined at random (it's always
advisable to save your game beforehand). You will then be given the option of
naming your Chocobo; I suggest naming your Chocobos in accordance with their
gender to make things a little easier i.e. Green F, Blue M etc.

You will also be able to view the Chocobos rating, and there are 8 ratings
available:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   RATING:     POSTURE:             CHOCOBO BILLY'S COMMENT:                |
|                                                                            |
| 1 Wonderful   Dashing, head down   "This... is a wonderful Chocobo!"       |
| 2 Great       Running              "This is a great Chocobo."              |
| 3 Good        Walking              "Mmm, this seems like a good Chocobo."  |
| 4 So-So       Standing still       "This Chocobo's so-so."                 |
| 5 Average     Standing still       "This is a pretty average Chocobo."     |
| 6 Poor        Standing still       "Mmm, this one's not bad."              |
| 7 Bad         Trotting, head down  "This one doesn't seem to be very good" |
| 8 Terrible    Trotting, head down  "I really can't recommend this one"     |
|                                                                            |
| Only the Good, Great and Wonderful Chocobos are used for breeding.         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 NOTE - If you were to take your chocobo on board the Highwind, you could
        talk to the NPC to find out which 'type' of chocobo it is.

When you first enter the Chocobo Ranch you will be able to obtain the
Choco/Mog Materia. This is done by talking to the nearest Chocobo, and
selecting option 1 ('Wark') when prompted. The Chocobos will then perform a
little dance, which is nice, you'll then be presented with the Materia. If
you didn't do this on Disk 1 then you'll still be able to obtain the Materia,
you'll just need to catch a few Chocobos first to fill your pen. You'll also
be able to find a Chocobo Lure Materia when you enter the area on Disk 2 at
the south side of the pen lying on the ground.

                                                              {Chocobo Tracks}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.14 D - Where To Find The Chocobo Tracks


  Each set of Chocobo tracks will have a pre-determined set of encounters,
and there are 7 Chocobo tracks scattered throughout Gaia:

 NOTE - For some weird reason, having 2 Chocobo Lure Materias equipped will
        make it impossible to encounter the 2x Elfadunk and 2x Levrikon
        formations. Equip just one Chocobo Lure and you'll be able to
        encounter them.

--E.14 E - Greens, Nuts And The Chocobo Sage


/..............\
|   {GREENS}   |
\``````````````/

Greens serve two functions, firstly they are used to distract enemy Chocobos
long enough for you to catch them. The second purpose they serve is to boost
your Chocobos racing stats, and you're going to need to spend upwards of
500,000 gil on Greens in order to get your Chocobos to where you'll need them
to be. Talk to Chocobo Billy to feed your Chocobos.

The stats that are affected by using Greens are:

Dash         - How quickly you sprint whilst holding O
Run          - How fast the Chocobos normal running speed is
Stamina      - How much stamina the Chocobo has
Acceleration - How quickly the Chocobo accelerates
Cooperation  - How obedient the Chocobo is under Manual control
Intelligence - How intelligently the Chocobo performs under Automatic control

The best Greens you can buy are the Sylkis Greens, and they cost a whopping
5000 gil each. The best way to obtain an abundance of Sylkis Greens is by
using the W-Item trick, however you won't gain access to the W-Item Materia
until late in Disk 2. The easiest way make the require amount of money early
on is to sell one of your mastered All Materias; the area around Mideel is a
great source of AP. A mastered All sells for 1.4 million gil!

As with the Nuts, many Greens have been mis-spelt, not only in the 'feeding'
menu but also in the Battle Square and in Mideel. Here are the Greens
available, along with their stat values and battle effects:

 *Bought from the Chocobo Sage's House.

  Mimett Greens can also be won form the Battle Square costing 1280BP before
  the Tiny Bronco, and 400BP after the Tiny Bronco. They will not be
  available after you obtain the Highwind. They are the only Greens that will
  increase your Acceleration.

Greens will have a healing effect if used on an ally in battle. Each Green
will have the same effect, which is to restore 100 HP. For a more in-depth
look at how we can manipulate the racing stats to breed the perfect Chocobo,
see section E.14 G below.

/............\
|    NUTS    |
\````````````/

Nuts are only used for breeding Chocobos, and the only two nuts you are
interested in are the Carob Nuts and the Zeio Nuts. When you talk to Chocobo
Billy, you must select 'Mating Chocobos' to mate two Chocobos together
(obviously), then once you have selected the two Chocobos that you wish to
mate you will be given the choice of which Nut you wish to use.  The better
the nut, the better the racing stat of the new born!

When buying from the Chocobo Ranch, the names of the Nuts will be displayed
correctly in the 'purchase' screen, however when you are selecting Nuts to
mate with, some of the name will have been mis-spelt:
  _____________ ____________ __________
 |             |            |          |
 |    NUT:     | MIS-SPELT: |  COST:   |
 |-------------+------------+----------|   CAROB NUT
 | Pepio Nut   | Pipio Nut  |  100 gil |
 |-------------+------------+----------|  The Carob Nut can be obtained in two
 | Luchile Nut | Ruchin Nut |  200 gil |  places, the first being the Wonder
 |-------------+------------+----------|  Square; talk to the receptionist to
 | Saraha Nut  | ---------- |  400 gil |  trade 500GP for the Carob Nut (prize
 |-------------+------------+----------|  ????). The much easier way of
 | Lasan Nut   | ---------- |  600 gil |  obtaining a Carob Nut would be to
 |-------------+------------+----------|  fight the Vlakorados near Bone
 | Pram Nut*   | Param Nut  | 1500 gil |  Village on the World Map. Be sure to
 |-------------+------------+----------|  have the Steal Materia equipped as
 | Porov Nut*  | Porofu Nut | 2000 gil |  Carob Nuts can be stolen from them.
 |-------------+------------+----------|  They do have a whopping 33,333 HP,
 | Carob Nut   | ---------- |  500 GP  |  so come prepared. The Carob Nut is
 |-------------+------------+----------|  used to breed a Green, Blue or Black
 | Zeio Nut    | ---------- | -------- |  Chocobo, so steal 3 of them.
 +-------------------------------------+
  *Bought from the Chocobo Sage's House

  ZEIO NUT

The Zeio Nut can be obtained by stealing from the Goblin found on Goblin
island, just to the north east of the Chocobo Ranch. The Goblin can only be
found in the Forests, and they also contain the Enemy Skill Goblin Punch. The
Zeio Nut is only used to breed a Gold Chocobo, so you'll just need to steal
one of them.

 NOTES - After you have mated two Chocobos you won't be able to mate them
         again until you have battled 3-10 times. The new born won't be ready
         to mate until you have battled 3-18 times. Escaping doesn't count.

       - There is an incredible amount of variation in the effects of each
         Nut. For a full run-down on each Nuts effect, scroll down to the
         bottom of the Chocobo breeding Section, or use QSI Link [Nuts].
         It's fascinating to know that Nuts other than the Carob can yield a
         Black Chocobo!

/....................\
|   {CHOCOBO SAGE}   |
\````````````````````/

Just to the north west of Bone Village (east of Icicle Inn) you will find a
lone house that is only accessible (initially) via the Highwind. This is the
Chocobo Sage's house. When you first arrive be sure to interact with the
Green Chocobo that you see to obtain the fourth and final Enemy Skill Materia.

When you talk to the Chocobo Sage he will either sell you some Greens or tell
you some information about Chocobo Breeding. The Nuts here are useless, and
the Sylkis Greens are twice as good as Reagan Greens in terms of their stat
boosting effects, and also cost less than twice the price, so just stay away
from Reagan Greens altogether.

If you ask the Sage if he remembers anything, he will begin to divulge
information on how to breed Chocobos, and this was the only way in which you
would've been able to learn how to breed a Gold Chocobo without the use of a
guide. After revealing a short amount of info, he will lose track of what he
was saying and you'll have to fight 4 - 7 battles before he will remember
anything else.

For a complete run-down on everything you have learnt from the Chocobo Sage
so-far, you must talk to Chloe who can be found in the Chocobo Ranch. She
will then give you a step-by-step guide on how to breed a Gold Chocobo.
She'll also tell you which Chocobo has the best racing stats.

There are 9 pieces of information in total:

|  TIPS BEFORE YOU START:                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| - It is recommended to complete the breeding sidequest in stages. Due to   |
|   the fact that you are required to complete between 3 to 9 battles before |
|   you can mate two adults again, and between 3 to 19 battles before you    |
|   can mate a new-born, you should consider continuing on with the story    |
|   in-between breeding.                                                     |
|                                                                            |
| - The story-line quests / side quests for you to complete that will rack   |
|   up some battles on Disk 2 are as follows:                                |
|                                                                            |
|    - Junon's Underwater Reactor Quest                                      |
|    - Return to Sector 5 (for Tifa's Premium Heart)                         |
|    - Da-chao Fire Cavern                                                   |
|    - Sunken Gelnika                                                        |
|    - Ancient Forest (Mountain Chocobo required)                            |
|                                                                            |
|   If done correctly then you should have managed to breed a Gold Chocobo   |
|   before the Midgar events towards the end of Disk 2.                      |
|                                                                            |
| - Sell your Mastered All Materias. Requiring 35,000 AP to master (which is |
|   low), you will bank a nifty 1.4 million gil, which should see you        |
|   through to the end of the game, let alone the Breeding process. If       |
|   you're on Disk 3 then the Swamp Area in the North Crater is the best     |
|   place for AP, failing that the Sea Worm or the Spiral near Mideel.       |
|                                                                            |
| - To ride a Chocobo that you've caught/bred, you must first talk to        |
|   Chocobo Billy and select 'Riding Chocobos'. Your Chocobos posture will   |
|   be relevant to which Class he/she is ranked as at the Chocobo Square:    |
|                                                                            |
|    - Dashing        - Class S                                              |
|    - Running        - Class A                                              |
|    - Walking        - Class B                                              |
|    - Standing still - Class C                                              |
|                                                                            |
| - When you are navigating on the World Map on your Chocobo, you can run up |
|   to the Highwind and press confirm to bring the Chocobo on board the      |
|   Highwind with you. This way you can bring a 'Special' Chocobo to a       |
|   different continent. Whilst on-board the Highwind you can pet your       |
|   Chocobo if you wish in the stables to the right of Operations.           |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

So then, let's begin breeding!

/.......................................................\
|   OBTAINING A {MOUNTAIN CHOCOBO} or {GREEN CHOCOBO}   |
\'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

In order to breed a Mountain Chocobo you must first catch two chocobos. The
'Good' Chocobos can be found on the Chocobo tracks near the Gold Saucer
alongside 2x Spencer (15.75% encounter rate). The 'Great' Chocobos can either
be found near Rocket Town alongside 2x Valron or 2x Kyuvilduns (31.5% total),
or near Mideel alongside either 1 or 2x Spirals (56% total).

 UPDATE - You could use 2 Good Chocobos, 2 Great Chocobos, or 1 Good + 1 Great
          Chocobo to mate, they would all have the same 'mating potential'.

Before you enter the Chocobo Ranch SAVE YOUR GAME! A gender will be chosen at
random when you move your Chocobos in from your pen, and you'll need them to
of opposite sex to breed them. Although it doesn't matter which gender the
Chocobos are for breeding, some (incorrect) sources have stated that a Great
female and a Good male is required. This is untrue; it doesn't matter what
the gender is as long as they are opposite.

Now that you have your 2 Great Chocobos of opposite sex, you must feed them
an un-predetermined amount of Greens to max out their stats. Feed them both
somewhere in the region of:

11 x Sylkis  Greens to max out Speed
15 x Pahsana Greens to raise Intelligence
60 x Curiel  Greens to raise Stamina
25 x Mimett  Greens to raise Acceleration

The last thing that you have to do before you can breed them is to race them
at the Chocobo Races in order to improve their class. Head over to the
Chocobo Square and talk to Ester to partake in the races. Once a Chocobo has
won three races he/she will move up one rank. All Chocobos start off as Class
C, and you only need to rank your Good and Great Chocobo up to Class B,
although a higher ranked Chocobo will have a better chance of breeding a
'special' Chocobo, so I recommend getting both Chocobos up to Class A
(technically, you just need 4 wins in total).

You are now ready to breed! Head over to the Chocobo Ranch and save your
game! Talk to Chocobo Billy to 'mate' Chocobos, selecting the Carob Nut as
your choice of Nut. There will be a 50/50 chance you will get a Mountain
Chocobo or a River Chocobo. The parents will not be able to mate again until
you have fought between 3 - 10 times, and the new-born will not be able to
mate until you have fought between 3 - 18 times (escaping from battle doesn't
count).

 NOTE - Due to poor programming, the Chocobos environmental 'abilities' have
        been reversed in the Chocobo Races; a Blue Chocobo will make short
        work of the steep slope on the short track; and a Green Chocobo won't
        be hindered by the water on the long track, and the space section at
        the end of the short track. A Black or Gold Chocobo will breeze
        through both tracks.

Now that you have a Mountain Chocobo, you can obtain the Materia hidden
within the Materia Cave south of Wutai, which is the Mime Materia. You can
also access the Ancient Forest just east of Cosmo Canyon, which you would not
normally be able to access until Ultimate WEAPON had been defeated. You can
also access Lucrecia's Cave near Gongaga, and accessing it via Chocobo is far
less of a pain than accessing it via Submarine.

/...................................................\
|   OBTAINING A {RIVER CHOCOBO} or {BLUE CHOCOBO}   |
\'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

Breeding a River Chocobo requires following the exact same steps as the
Mountain Chocobo; however if you have already obtained a Mountain Chocobo
then all you need to do is to mate the same parents again; you do not need to
catch another wild 'Good' and/or 'Great' Chocobo. You must make sure that the
sex of the River Chocobo is opposite to that of the Mountain Chocobo.

If you have not yet obtained a Mountain Chocobo then refer to the steps above
to learn how to breed a River Chocobo, as the steps are exactly the same.
Once you have a River Chocobo then you can access the Materia Cave north east
of Mideel, which contains the Quadra Magic Materia.

 NOTE - If you find that you keep breeding the same breed and/or sex of
        Chocobo, then you'll need to reset the RNG (Random Number Generator).
        To do this you must either perform a soft reset, and/or enter the
        Chocobo Ranch to feed a random Green to a random Chocobo, then save
        again. This should 'jog' the RNG.

/.................................................................\
|   OBTAINING A {MOUNTAIN-AND-RIVER CHOCOBO} or {BLACK CHOCOBO}   |
\'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

In order to obtain a Black Chocobo you must first breed a Green and Blue
Chocobo of opposite sex (see above). Feed each Chocobo somewhere in the
region of:

11 x Sylkis  Greens  to max out Speed
20 x Pahsana Greens  to max out Intelligence
60 x Mimett  Greens  to max out Acceleration
60 x Curiel  Greens  to max out Stamina

As with your 'Good' and 'Great' Chocobos, you are going to have to race your
Green and Blue Chocobos at the Chocobo races in order to rank them up to
Class A. It is highly unlikely that you'll be able to get them to Class S,
especially if Teioh if on the track! They'll 9 wins between them to have a
100% chance of breeding a Black Chocobo

Using the last of your 3 Carob Nuts, mate your Green and Blue Chocobos
together (remembering to save beforehand) to breed a Black Chocobo! Hoo-rah!
A Mountain-and-River Chocobo can access the cave near Corel, which contains
the HP<->MP Materia.

/....................................................\
|   OBTAINING AN {OCEAN CHOCOBO} or {GOLD CHOCOBO}   |
\''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

Breeding an Ocean Chocobo is the ultimate Chocobo available, and it can
access every part of Gaia including Round Island in the North eastern corner
of the map, but excluding the ocean floor (it's not really an Ocean Chocobo
then, is it? It should be called a 'Jesus Chocobo' [because it can walk on
water]).

 NOTE - You can now release your 'Good' and 'Great' Chocobos back into the
        wild.

Before doing anything else, you must first catch a 'Wonderful' Chocobo. These
can be found on the Chocobo tracks to the west of Icicle Inn, and will only
be present alongside 1 or 2x Jumping (19.5% total encounter rate). Once you
have caught one you can move him into your stables, making sure that it is of
the opposite gender to the Black Chocobo (save first).

Now that you have your two Chocobos, feed each of them roughly:

21 x Sylkis  Greens to max out Speed
30 x Pahsana Greens to max out Intelligence
75 x Mimett  Greens to max out Acceleration
75 x Curiel  Greens to max out Stamina (or Kurie Greens)

Although you won't be able to rank your Wonderful Chocobo up higher than
Class A, you should be able to get your Mountain-and-River Chocobo up to
Class S. You'll need 12 wins in total. When they are ready to breed, save
your game and then mate them using a Zeio Nut. Viola! A Gold Chocobo! You can
now obtain the Knights of The Round Materia from the Materia Cave on Round
Island (NE on map).

I suggest feeding you Gold Chocobo 25 Sylkis Greens and 99 Mimett Greens just
to be sure that you've maxed out its stats. You should never again lose in
the Chocobo Races, unless of course you're up against Teioh, whose stats are
always better than yours (ignoring the 'cap'). You can speak to Chloe at in
the Chocobo Stables to find out which Chocobo has the best stats.

--E.14 G - Breeding The 'Ultimate' Racing Chocobo

  Big thank you to gmo7897 for clarifying up a lot of questions with his
  Chocobo Breeding guide!


  The following information should clarify exactly how to breed the ultimate
racing Chocobo! You must firstly aim to get the 'perfect' parents, as the
stats of the parents will directly reflect the stats of their offspring, and
understanding how the stats work is paramount to perfecting your breeding
skills.

 Here are the various stats that are in use:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| STAT:        | DESCRIPTION:                                      |    MAX: |
|--------------+---------------------------------------------------+---------|
| Max Dash     | The maximum speed a Chocobos Dash can reach       |    6000 |
|*Dash         | The speed at which a Chocobo will sprint          |Max Dash |
| Max Run      | The maximum speed a Chocobos Run can reach        |    5900 |
| Run          | The speed at which a Chocobo will run             | Max Run |
|*Stamina      | The amount of stamina the Chocobo has             |    9999 |
| Acceleration | The speed at which a Chocobo accelerates          |      80 |
| Intelligence | The Chocobos ability to perform in Automatic mode |     100 |
| Co-Operation | The Chocobos ability to perform in Manual mode    |     100 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

**THE ONLY FIGURES THAT WE NEED TO MANIPULATE ARE MAX DASH AND MAX RUN**

  These are the two visible stats that you can see when you are in the lobby
  screen just before a race:

  Speed   = Dash/34. This gives a maximum of 176 KPH (6000/34 = 176)
  Stamina = Stamina/10. This gives a maximum of 999  (9999/10 = 999)

When you catch a wild Chocobo, a random figure will be generated for each
stat. These figures will generate themselves at the point in which you move
the Chocobo from the pen into the stables. Each figure will have a 'range' as
follows:

             (Max Dash)  (Max Run)  (Dash)   (Run)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  CHOCOBO: | MAX SPRNT | MAX SPD  | SPRNT |  SPD  | STAMINA | ACCEL | INTL  |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Wonderful | 99 - 121  | 91 - 112 | 50-97 | 38-91 | 337-463 | 60-70 | 50-60 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Great     | 85 - 110  | 76 - 100 | 42-88 | 30-82 | 287-393 | 60-70 | 50-60 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Good      | 79 - 101  | 67 - 95  | 39-81 | 28-75 | 247-363 | 50-60 | 30-40 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| So-So     | 67 - 92   | 55 - 86  | 33-74 | 22-68 | 247-343 | 50-60 | 30-40 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Average   | 55 - 86   | 40 - 80  | 17-70 | 17-64 | 167-263 | 30-50 |  0-20 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Poor      | 49 - 71   | 35 - 66  | 15-58 |  0-52 |  87-213 | 30-50 |  0-20 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Bad       | 40 - 63   | 26 - 57  | 12-51 |  0-45 |  67-143 | 20-50 |  0-20 |
|-----------+-----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+-------+-------+
| Terrible  | 35 - 57   | 20 - 51  | 10-46 |  0-40 |  37-113 | 20-50 |  0-20 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 NOTES - Co-Op will always be set to 0 when first caught.
       - Acceleration and Intelligence will always land on a figure divisible
         by 10.
       - Usually, the higher the Max Sprint is when the stats are first
         generated, the lower the Stamina will be, and vice-versa.

 Max Dash and Dash are worked out accordingly:
 Max Sprint*34 = Max Dash
     Sprint*34 = Dash

 Max Run and Run are worked out accordingly:
 Max Speed*34 = Max Run
     Speed*34 = Run

  ALSO:

 - Max Sprint and Max Speed are the only values we care about when catching
   wild Chocobos, although there's no real way to determine the Max Speed
   (Sprint can be viewed in the Chocobo Races).

 - Always bring Speed up to Max Speed and Sprint up to Max Sprint straight
   away using Sylkis Greens.

Unfortunately, there is now way of determining your exact stats, other than
Speed and Stamina. If you are looking for the ultimate Chocobo, then I
suggest catching a Great Chocobo, feeding it Sylkis Greens to max out its
Speed, and then checking to see what his/her Speed is within the Chocobo
Races.

If it is 85 then you have the worst possible 'Great' Chocobo, if it's 110
then you have the best possible 'Great' Chocobo. Stamina won't matter as
there is no 'cap' on Stamina (or any other stat for that matter, excluding
Max Dash and Max Run).

All stats apart from Max Sprint (Max Dash) and Max Speed (Max Run) can be
increased using Greens:

  If Dash = 4000, then (X) would be 400 (4000/10 = 400) (Sylkis Greens)
  Let's say the random number (Y) was 8.
  You would have a 50/50 chance of you Dash being increased by 408, or 392

    A 'simpler' way at looking at those formula's would be:

         Reagan Greens:       |  Sylkis Greens:
                              |
         Dash + 5% (approx)   |  Dash + 10% (approx)
          Run + 5% (approx)   |   Run + 10% (approx)
         Stam + 1% (approx)   |  Stam + 2%  (approx)
         CoOp + 3             |  Intl + 1 - 4
                              |  CoOp + 4

So, the main thing that we can see is that the Sylkis Greens are precisely
twice as good as the Reagan Greens. The Pahsana Greens are great for
Intelligence, and the Mimett Greens are the only Green to increase
Acceleration, which it will only do 25% of the time. Curiel Greens are good
for Stamina, also.

The next thing you need to know about 'Ultimate' Chocobo breeding are the

You should now have all the tools necessary to start breeding your prize-
winning Chocobo. Here's how:

/..............................................\
|   HOW TO BREED THE ULTIMATE RACING CHOCOBO   |
\''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

Before Starting:

 - It's worth noting that you can very easily reach the maximum stat value
   for Stamina, Acceleration, Intelligence and Co-Operation. The only two
   figures that we need to try to manipulate are Max Dash and Max Run.

 - Co-Operation always starts at 0 for a new-born, and caps at 100, so 25
   Sylkis Greens will do the trick. Intelligence will max out at 100 and can
   be maxed using Pahsana Greens, and Stamina can be maxed out using Curiel
   Greens which will max out at 9999 (or 999 in the races).

 - Acceleration is the biggest pain in the backside to max as a Mimett Green
   will have a 25% chance of increasing Acceleration by +1, so just keep
   feeding it Mimett Greens (around 100+) until you are happy that it value
   has reached 80.

 - Run and Dash can very easily be maxed (to Max Run and Max Dash) by using
   9 Sylkis Greens. Remember that if you have two Chocobos with maxed out
   Stamina (9999), Intelligence (100) and Acceleration (80), the offspring
   will be born with all three of these stats maxed.

 STEP 1:

Catch two Great Chocobos. Before moving them into the stables, SAVE YOUR
GAME! Remember that the stats are generated for the Chocobo at the point in
which you move them across from the pen, so don't move both in at the same
time. Remember that Chloe will tell the 'best' Chocobos stats for Max Dash,
Max Run, Acceleration and Intelligence.

You won't be able to determine the Acceleration or Intelligence (which
shouldn't matter too much at this stage), however you will be able to measure
the Stamina, Dash and Max Dash. Co-Operation is always set to 0 to begin with.

After feeding the Chocobo as many Sylkis Greens as is necessary to max out
its Speed (bringing its Dash value to the same as its Max Dash - 11 or so),
head over to the Gold Saucer (don't worry about maxing its other stats). If
its Speed isn't above 105 (ish), reset your game and try moving the Chocobo
into the stables again. The max speed you can have from a great Chocobo is
110 KPH.

 NOTES - The Max Run is always proportionate to the Max Dash, so a Chocobo
         with a high 'Top Speed' should also have a fairly high running speed.

       - Every time you reset, make sure to do a soft reset as to keep the
         RNG from being reset, unless it gets stuck and keeps giving you the
         same stats, in which case perform one hard reset, followed by soft
         resets from there on out.

Once you are happy with your Great Chocobos Max Dash stats, save the game and
repeat the process with your other Great Chocobo. The down side here is that
you'll also have a 50/50 chance of it being the wrong gender, but the plus
side is that it won't matter if the second Chocobo isn't all that great, you
only have to have one great 'Great' Chocobo (although it will help down the
line if you have two). You'll be ready to continue when you have two Great
Chocobos, one of which with great Max Dash (Top Speed) stats!

  STEP 2:

Using Sylkis, Mimett, Curiel and Pahsana Greens, max out both Chocobo stats
completely. Then race them and then save your game. *Make note of which
Chocobo has the best stats by talking to Chloe*. Breed the two Chocobos
together using a Carob Nut. You will have a 23.4% chance that the new-born
will have higher Max Dash and 15.6% that it will have higher Max Run than the
parents with the highest Max Dash/Run (Stamina won't matter), giving you a
cumulative 3.65% chance of getting a Chocobo with better Max Run and Max Dash.

Don't worry too much about getting a better Max Run (Speed) at this stage,
just concentrate on getting a Chocobo with better Max Dash (Sprint) than its
parents. A Chocobos Speed can never exceed its Sprint, so focus first on
maxing out Max Dash, which is 6000 (or 176 KPH).

Now talk to Chloe in the Chocobo Ranch (you don't have to feed the newborn
any Greens), and she will tell you which Chocobo has the fastest Sprint
(MDash) and which is the fastest runner (MRun), if the new-born doesn't have
Dash that surpasses its parents, reload your save and try again, we'll focus
on Run later on when we breed a Gold Chocobo (the Zeio Nut has a much better
chance than the Carob Nut of breeding a Chocobo with higher Run than its
parents).

Don't forget about that pesky RNG - if it gets stuck and keeps spitting the
same stats, then try feeding Greens to your Chocobos.

  STEP 3:

Let's say you'd just obtained a Green Chocobo with better Max Dash and better
Max Run than its parents. You'll obviously want to breed a Blue Chocobo next
using the same parents, however it doesn't matter whether this new Chocobo
has better stats than its parents or not. You won't be able to tell anyway,
seeing as Chloe can only tell you who has the 'best' stats, and the new
Chocobos stats can only be equal to or less than its sibling.

 NOTE - If a Chocobo succeeds in gaining a boost in stats (say, Max Dash),
        then it will be boosted using the parent *with the highest (Max Dash)
        stats.* This means that your 'secondary' Chocobo doesn't have to be
        as 'optimal' as you first Chocobo. Most other stats will take an
        average of both parents, so be sure to try to max Stamina,
        Acceleration and Intelligence on both choc's, just remember that Co-
        Op is always set to 0 when a new-born is hatched.

Go ahead and mate the two parents again. Make sure to max out all of the
stats that you can for both Chocobos, then race them both to Class A. Save
the game, then mate the Green and Blue together using a Carob Nut. Then check
with Chloe to see if his/her 'Sprint' (and hopefully 'Speed') has surpassed
his/her parents. If they haven't, reload your save; if they have, max out its
stats.

Once you have a Black Chocobo, you can release the 'weakest' Great Chocobo
back into the wild.

  STEP 4:

Now catch a Wonderful Chocobo. It doesn't matter in the slightest what the
Chocobos Max Dash is, just be sure to max out its stats before breeding. Also
be sure to check with Chloe to see which Chocobo has the highest Max Dash and
Max Run before doing anything else.

One you are content that you have the best Black Chocobo 'for the job', go
ahead and save the game. Then mate the two together using a Zeio Nut (after
racing, obviously), you'll now have a 22% chance of the new-born having a
higher Max Dash, 32% chance of it having higher Max Run and 68% chance of it
having higher Stamina (see Zeio Nut details above). The cumulative chance of
getting better Max Dash and Max Run is 7.04%.

**MAKE SURE THAT THE GOLD CHOCOBO HAS HIGHER MAX DASH AND MAX RUN THAN ITS
PARENTS**

If the Chocobo receives the 'average' of its parents Max Run/Dash, then the
drop could be quite considerable. Remember to 'jog' the RNG from time to
time. If done correctly, the Chocobo should have the number one spot for all
of Chloe's inspections. Now max out all of your Gold Chocobos stats, then
check to see if its Max Dash has been maxed to 176KPH by competing in the
races.

  STEP 5:

Breed another Gold Chocobo using the same parents. Again, this Chocobos stats
won't matter, all that'll matter is that it is of the opposite sex to the
first Gold Chocobo, and that its current stats have been maxed out using
Greens before breeding it. Once you've done this, check with Chloe to confirm
which Chocobo has the greatest at this stage (it should be the first Gold
Chocobo).

Breed the two Gold Chocobos together, ensuring that the new Chocobos stats
are the greatest for *both* Dash and Run by talking to Chloe (before feeding
it Greens to max out its stats). Then release the 'parent' gold Chocobo of
the same sex as the new-born into the wild, so you can mate mother and
son/father and daughter together (ugh!).

Keep repeating this final process until you are content you have the 'best'
racing Chocobo possible.

  Max Speed   - 176KPH
  Max Stamina - 999
 (Max Run     - 173KPH)

Although you cannot see how fast your Run is, the fastest it can goto is
173KPH, so you'll know when you have the optimal Max Run stat because
there'll be little difference in speed when you push down O to sprint.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CONGRATULATIONS - YOU NOW HAVE THE 'PERFECT' CHOCOBO!                      |
| So what can you do now?                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Teioh:

You still need to watch out for Teioh, as Teioh's Max Dash will always be 10%
greater than yours, and his Stamina will always be 25% greater than yours.
These figures will ignore all 'caps'. As long as you have a very high Run you
should be fine.

  Special Prizes:

Winning 10 Class S races in a row will reward you with a special bundle of
prizes: Counter Attack Materia, Sprint Shoes, Cat's Bell, Precious Watch and
Chocobracelet. These prizes can only be won once.

  Stamina Refill:

Just to make it that bit easier, you can hold down R1+R2 to slowly refill
your Stamina bar. This shouldn't be necessary seeing as your Run and your
Dash should be near enough the same, meaning you won need to sprint.

  Make a cup of tea:

With Automatic mode enabled!?!

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| O.K., so not a phat lot!!                                                  |

|   OBTAIN A *FREE* GOLD CHOCOBO   |
\''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

If you defeat Ruby WEAPON then you will be rewarded with the Desert Rose. You
can then present this to the Kalm Traveller (found in... Kalm) and he will
trade it with you for a Gold Chocobo. The catch-22 is that you need the
Knights of The Round Materia to defeat Ruby, and you need a Gold Chocobo to
obtain the Knights of The Round Materia..... Of course there are other ways
of defeating Ruby (see section E.16).

The 'Kalm Chocobo' is an absolutely terrible racing Chocobo by the way, it
stats are as follows:

Max Dash - 3000 (Top Sprint = 88 KPH)
    Dash - 1000
 Max Run - 2500 (Top Speed = 74 KPH)
     Run - 500
 Stamina - 1000 (Stamina = 100)
Acclertn - 60
Intllgnc - 30
Co-Oprtn - 0

/.................................\
|   CHOCOBOS THAT GIVE US STUFF   |
\'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

At any point during the game you can talk to the Chocobos that are sitting in
the pen at the Chocobo Ranch. When prompted, select option 1 "Wark" to see a
little dance. You will then be presented with the almighty Choco/Mog Materia!
This little bad-boy is best paired with the Elemental Materia on your weapon,
as it is Wind based and a large amount of enemies in the game are weak
against Wind.

When you visit the Chocobo Sage on Disk 2 (or Disk 3), you will notice a
Green Chocobo sitting in its stable. Interact with it and it'll give to you
an Enemy Skill Materia! Cheers Chocobo!

If you talk to Chloe before she has obtained any information about the
Chocobo Sage then she will tell you that 'the white Chocobo likes to be
scratched behind its ears, anywhere else and it'll get mad'. This is a
reference to the White Chocobo in Mideel; be sure to feed it a Mimett Green
(although it'll read Samolen Green), then tickle it behind its ears to
receive the incredible Contain Materia!

/..........................\
|   ESTERS CHOCOBO STATS   |
\''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

When you attempt to race for freedom just after the Corel Prison events on
Disk 1, you will be given a Chocobo in which to race with from Ester. If you
lose on this Chocobo then the Chocobo you will be given for the next race
will be slightly better. You will keep getting a better Chocobo until the
fourth Chocobo, you'll then be stuck with that one until you win (which in
all fairness should be pretty easy seeing the 4th Chocobo is fairly slick).

The four Chocobos are as follows:

Chocobo 1:                             | Chocobo 2:
'''''''''                              | '''''''''

|  {CHOCOBUCKLE}  |
\'''''''''''''''''/

Chocobuckle is a fairly useless Enemy Skill that can be first obtained when
you visit the Chocobo Ranch on Disk 1. The enemy Skill will basically
increase by 1HP worth of damage (ignoring defences) for every time you have
escaped from battle. So, potentially you could do 9999 worth of damage for as
little as 3MP, although escaping that many times would take an unrealistic
amount of time to accomplish. A better use of Chocobuckle would be to escape
2222 times in order to active 'All Lucky Seven's' (9999HP - 2222 = 7777).

To learn the Enemy Skill, you must first encounter a wild Chocobo. You must
then feed the Chocobo either a Mimett Green or a Sylkis Green; this will
activate the Chocobos use of Chocobuckle. You must then knock the Chocobos
health down to 3.125% (1/32) in one hit, the Chocobo will then retaliate by
casting Chocobuckle as a counter attack on its attacker. There is only one
move that can perform this - L4 Suicide.

Due to the fact that only a Chocobo with a level divisible by 4 can be hit
with Chocobuckle, you can only learn Chocobuckle in two places - the
Grasslands Area (near Chocobo Ranch) alongside either 2x Elfadunk or 2x
Levrikon (Lv 16), or Mideel Area alongside 1x or 2x Spiral (Lv 36). You can
learn L4 Suicide from Mu in the Grasslands Area, and he will have a 7% chance
of casting it.

/...................\
|   PERSONALITIES   |
\'''''''''''''''''''/

There are also three 'obscure' ratings which can be attributed to a Chocobos
'Personality' (or 'Run Type'):

   Personality 0 = Running Chocobo at the lobby screen in the races
   Personality 1 = Running Chocobo at the lobby screen in the races
   Personality 2 = Dashing Chocobo at the lobby screen in the races

Other than aesthetically, the personality of a Chocobo will not modify the
Chocobos performance in any way; the Chocobo will behave exactly the same in
a race as it normally would, regardless of its personality. The information
regarding Personalities is hazy, and from what I can gather personality 0
would be considered the 'normal' or 'primary' personality, while 1 & 2 would
be considered the 'lower-ranking' or 'secondary' personalities.

  Wonderful or Great Chocobo - 87.5% chance of Personality 0
                               6.25% chance of Personality 1
                               6.25% chance of Personality 2

       Good or So-So Chocobo - 75%   chance of Personality 0
                               12.5% chance of Personality 1
                               12.5% chance of Personality 2

     Average or Poor Chocobo - 50%   chance of Personality 0
                               25%   chance of Personality 1
                               25%   chance of Personality 2

    Weak or Terrible Chocobo - 50%   chance of Personality 0
                               25%   chance of Personality 1
                               25%   chance of Personality 2

It is possible to remove the current personality of your Chocobo to set it to
0, this is done by feeding a Chocobo enough Pahsana Greens. Chocobo Billy
will comment "their personality's improved!" if done correctly. There is no
ascertain way of being able to tell the difference between personality 0 and
1.

/..............................\
|  {RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION}  |                                         {RNG}
\''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

  Shout out to BrutalAl for his extensive knowledge on how the RNG works!

REMEMBER TO SAVE OFTEN WHEN MANIPULATING THE RNG!

The Random Number Generator (or RNG) is the computers way of generating an
outcome; nothing is actually random, and by knowing how to manipulate the RNG
you will be able to breed the exact breed and sex of Chocobo you are after,
without even having to race!

There are multiple RNG's in the game, for example the Battle RNG. This will
have 256 possible outcomes (0-255), and performing various things can advance
the marker to the next outcome. For example, when you use Choco/Mog, you will
have a 241/256 chance of getting DeathBlow (94.1%) and a 15/256 chance of
getting Fat Chocobo (5.95%). If the marker has landed on one of the 15
squares that has Fat Chocobo against it, then Fat Chocobo will be used. The
marker will advance 1 or more places every time certain actions are performed.

Seeing as we are only looking at Chocobo Breeding, I am only going to focus
on the actions that advance the Chocobo RNG:

Feeding Chocobo Krakka Greens - 1 marker per Krakka Green
Mating Chocobos - 1 marker
Moving Chocobos - 1 marker
Entering the area outside the stables (screen with pen) - 2 markers
Standing outside the stables (screen with pen) - 1 marker per second
Hard Reset - resets marker back to 0.

As far as I can tell, the Chocobo RNG has 256 numbers (0-255).
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| When you perform a Hard Reset, the marker will move back to position 0.    |
| When you perform a Soft Reset (L1 R1 L2 R2 Start + Select) the marker will |
| stay where it is. This knowledge is crucial for manipulating the RNG.      |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

When you enter the 'pen' area, the marker will advance two places. With the
RNG at 002, you'll need to feed a Chocobo 23 Krakka Greens to bring it to
025, resulting in a Blue Female.

After lengthy testing, I can safely say that the Greens used to capture the
Chocobo, and the location in which you caught the Chocobos makes no
difference whatsoever; the RNG sequence is always constant. It does however
make a difference which Chocobo you select first when mating, unless they are
both the same rank (Great, Good etc.).

UPDATE - THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHOCOBO MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!! You will
         get different results when breeding Chocobos that have different
         Personalities from previous tests. A lot more testing is required.

Lastly, if you spend too long getting into the stables from the screen
outside of it, then the RNG will be at 003 instead of 002. The marker will
automatically increase two places when you enter the screen with the pen, and
then the marker will start to increase by 1 every second thereafter. There is
a delay before the 'second' marker will begin however, and if you run into
the barn quick enough then you should be able to safely keep the RNG at 002.
Just don't hang about.

Using the above info, you should be able to obtain the desired breed of
Chocobo, so long as you know the outcome of the RNG' positions:

2x Great Chocobos with 0 wins (Personality 0 & 1):

@RNG-004 = Green Male
@RNG-006 = Green Female
@RNG-032 = Blue Male
@RNG-025 = Blue Female

|   OBTAINING A GOLD CHOCOBO *WITHOUT* HAVING TO RACE   |
\'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''/

 - Works on both PS1 and PS4 versions. I cannot confirm for PC versions.

If you've read the previous section pertaining to RNG then you should be
equipped with the knowledge of how to manipulate the RNG as to obtain a
Chocobo of your choice. Here is the method to gaining a Gold Chocobo, without
having to race:
                                                 (Credit - BrutalAl & gmo7897)
 Prerequisite:

Capture 1x Great Chocobo (Mideel - alongside Spiral)
Capture 1x Wonderful Chocobo (Icicle Inn - alongside Jumping)
Steal   2x Carob Nuts
Steal   1x Zeio Nut
Buy     1x Saraha Nut
Buy    62x Krakka Greens

Using the RNG sequence below, you should be able to breed a Gold Chocobo in
less than an hour (without having to race once):

@RNG-002 Move Great                      = Great Female.
@RNG-003 Move Wonderful                  = Wonderful Male.
@RNG-003 Mate Great + Wonderful          = Blue Female.  Then fight 6 battles
@RNG-052 Mate Great + Wonderful          = Green Male.   Then fight 8 battles
@RNG-007 Mate Blue  + Green (Saraha Nut) = Black Female. Then fight 3 battles
@RNG-008 Mate Black + Wonderful          = Gold Female

Remember to save and Hard Reset just before you're about to breed. This
method will require you to participate in 0 races at the Chocobo Square, and
17 battles outside the Chocobo Ranch.

!!WHEN TRYING FOR A BLUE/GREEN, YOU *MUST* SELECT THE GREAT CHOCOBO FIRST!!

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1.)  With a Great and Wonderful Chocobo in your pen, save your game and
     perform a hard reset. The RNG should now be at 000.

2.)  Run into the stables without hanging about outside, the RNG should now be
     at 002.

3.)  Move your Great Chocobo. This should be a Female. The RNG should now be
     at 003.

4.)  Move your Wonderful Chocobo. This should be a Male. Now save your game
     and perform a hard reset. The RNG should now be at 000.

5.)  Run into the stables without hanging about outside, the RNG should now be
     at 002. Feed one Krakka Green to a Chocobo. The RNG should now be at 003.

6.)  Mate the Great and Wonderful Chocobos (selecting Great first). You
     should get a Blue Female.

7.) Now fight in 6 random battles, then save and perform a hard reset.

8.)  Run into the stables without hanging about outside, the RNG should now be
     at 002. Feed 50 Krakka Greens to a Chocobo to bring the RNG to 052.

9.)  Mate the Great and Wonderful Chocobos. You should get a Green Male.

10.) Now fight in 8 random battles, then save and perform a hard reset.

11.)  Run into the stables without hanging about outside, the RNG should now
      be at 002. Feed 5 Krakka Greens to a Chocobo to bring the RNG to 007.

12.) Mate the Green and Blue Chocobos using a Saraha Nut (it doesn't matter
     which one you pick first). You should get a Black Female.

13.) Now fight 3 random battles, then save and perform a hard reset.

14.) Run into the stables without hanging about outside, the RNG should now be
     at 002. Feed 6 Karaka Greens to a Chocobo to bring the RNG to 008.

15.) Mate the Black and Wonderful Chocobo using a Zeio Nut (you need to
     select the Black Chocobo first). You should get a Gold Female.
     Congratulations!

After trying it myself, I can safely say that this method works perfectly on
both the PS1 version and the PS4 version. You must remember to select the
Great Chocobo first when breeding a Blue/Green Chocobo, and you must remember
to enter the barn rather quickly.

Using the battle glitch as mentioned in the section just below, combined with
this technique of RNG manipulation, BrutalAl was able to breed a Gold Chocobo
in under four minutes (having first caught the Great & Wonderful Chocobo)!

/........................\
|   MISCELLANEOUS INFO   |
\''''''''''''''''''''''''/

 - There is a glitch that will occur after you reach a ridiculously high
   amount of battles - 32,767. The game cannot use a number higher than
   32,767, and if you were to battle your 32,768th battle, then the game
   would revert you to minus figures, and would consider your battle count to
   be -32,768. You would then need to fight a whopping 32,768 battles for the
   count to reset back to 0, in which time you would not be able to breed
   Chocobos at all!

   If you were to attempt to breed on you 37,767th battle, the game would
   permanently regard the battle count required for breeding as 0 (because it
   cannot calculate a figure higher than 32,767), meaning you could breed
   Chocobos endlessly without having to battle in-between breeding!

 - Although many guides will claim that you can only mate a Great and a Good
   Chocobo together to breed a Green/Blue Chocobo, this is false. You could
   also us 2x Good Chocobos or 2x Great Chocobos. I have conformed this
   myself.

 - Lucrecia's Cave is situated near Gongaga and North Corel. It can be
   accessed via the Submarine, but it can also be accessed via a Green, Black
   or Gold Chocobo before you can obtain the Submarine. It can take quite a
   long time to find Lucrecia's Cave using the Sub, so the Chocobo route is
   by far the best route. Vincent's Ultimate Weapon and L4 Limit Break Manual
   can be found in there.

 - The Ancient Forest is situated just east of Cosmo Canyon on a ledge that's
   just out of reach... unless you have a special Chocobo of course! Through
   the course of natural game-play, the Ancient Forest will become available
   to you when you kill Ultimate WEAPON, however through Chocobo breeding you
   can gain early access to this little treasure cove. Note-worthy items
   include the Slash-All Materia and the Apocalypse (triple growth weapon).

 - When you visit Sector 6 playground at the beginning of the game, you will
   notice Tifa being escorted on a Chocobo-and-carriage. This is the same
   design as the carriage that will escort you out of Corel Desert after 12
   screen of being lost!

 - The only way to determine what your Chocobos stats Top Speed and Stamina
   is to enter it into a race at the Chocobo Square - the stats will be
   displayed in the top right corner of screen.

 - A Green and Blue Chocobo will have their abilities reversed when racing at
   the Chocobo Square. There are two environment hazards on the short track -
   The hill section will be overcome by the Blue Chocobo, and the space
   section at the end will be overcome by the Green Chocobo. The long track
   has one environment hazard, the water section, which is overcome by the
   Green Chocobo. The Black and Gold Chocobo will plough through all hazards.

 - Teioh is the only AI Chocobo that has environmental abilities.

Earlier on in the 'Ultimate Racing Chocobo' section I began listing in-depth
descriptions of how each Nut worked, however I'd decided to only show the
Zeio and Carob Nut seeing as those were the only two nuts that we were using.
I've now decided (for what it's worth) to list every single Nut here:

     IN ALL CASES:                             (Credit: GMO7897 & TFergusson))

 - Acceleration and Intelligence will always be the average of the parents.

 - Cooperation will always be set to 0.

 - The Gender chosen will always be a 50/50 chance, or thereabouts.

 - Every Chocobos will be born as a Class C Chocobos.

 - If a Chocobo is born with Max Run that is equal to or higher than Max Dash,
   Max Run will reduce by 100 repeatedly until it is lower than Max Dash.

 - If a Chocobo is born with Run that is equal to or higher than Max Run, Run
   will reduce by 100 repeatedly until it is lower than Max Run.

 - The 'Rating' of the Chocobo (Great, Good etc.) will always have 50% of
   being its fathers, and 50% chance of being its mothers.

 - You will be able to breed a Black Chocobo using any Nut except for the
   Zeio Nut, and only the Carob Nut will breed a Blue or Green Chocobo.

Whilst inside one of the four Materia Caves that are scattered across Gaia,
random battle encounters will be disabled.

                                                          {Wutai Materia Cave}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.15 A - Wutai Cave


  Probably the most rewarding of the four rewards, the cave near Wutai holds
the Mime Materia, and can be accessed via a Green, Black or Gold Chocobo. The
Green Chocobo cannot access any other Materia Cave.

                                                                        {Mime}
The Mime Materia will allow you to mimic the previous command that an ally
used. This includes things such as counter attacks, summons, almost anything
really, except Limit Breaks. You can however mimic your own Limit Break,
which will help out in the Battle Square. Mime is often used in conjunction
with Knights of The Round Materia as an effective strategy for defeating
Emerald and Ruby WEAPON.

If you are planning on using a KOTR chain with Mime, then be sure to remove
all counter attack based Materias, as a character will also mimic a counter
if it was the last attack to have been used. Also, if you were to pair HP
Absorb with KOTR, then the person miming would also receive HP from the
attack. When using Mime, no MP will be consumed.


                                                         {Mideel Materia Cave}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.15 B - Mideel Cave


  The cave near Mideel can be found on the very north peninsula of the South-
Western Continent, and can only be accessed via a Blue, Black or Gold
Chocobo. You must park the Highwind on the small patch of grass just south of
Mideel, then ride your Blue Chocobo all the way north to the cave. Inside the
cove you will find the Quadra Magic Materia.

                                                                {Quadra Magic}
Quadra Magic is best used when combined with other Support Materia i.e.
Quadra Magic=Lightning, Magic Counter=Lightning and MP Turbo=Lightning etc.
Magic Counter, Final Attack and Sneak Attack are the only three Materias that
can be combined with Quadra Magic to enable an automatic 4x hit. If an enemy
dies during the four castings, then any unused casts would be discarded.

All magic spells will have their power reduced by 50% when paired with Quadra
Magic, and this includes % based attacks such as Demi and Full Cure. This is
why MP Turbo comes in handy. Even though you are hitting 4 times, your MP
consumption will be as if you had cast the spell but once. If you were to
equip two Quadra Magics to a spell then you would increase the amount of
casts by 1 to give you 5 casts. This can be repeated up four times for a
total of 8 casts. Knights of The Round cannot be paired with Quadra Magic.

There is a glitch which involves you landing you Highwind in a particular
spot to enable you to enter the Materia Cave without the use of a Chocobo.
From the Materia Cave, follow the peninsula down until you see a green bit of
grass leading from a cliff. Hover over the green land facing south, so the
dirt area is to your left. Now you must side-strafe left (by holding Square)
and press X just before you leave the grass area, whilst still holding left..

You probably won't do it on your first attempt; jump back in your Highwind,
position yourself so your facing South, and try again. Try strafing further
over to the right, then back again pressing X just before you leave the
grassy area. Once performed correctly you'll have landed the Highwind on the
very edge of the cliff, with Cloud on the dirt track. I was able to achieve
it after 2 dozen or so tries.

                                                          {Corel Materia Cave}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.15 C - Corel Cave


  Near the entrance to Mt. Corel you will notice the Materia Cave surrounded
by desert. This cave is only accessible via a Black or Gold Chocobo. The
HP<->MP Materia can be found within the cove, and it is probably the worst of
the four rewards.

                                                                     {HP<->MP}
HP<->MP will basically swap your HP figure for your MP figure, so your HP
will max at 999 and your MP will max at 9999. Useless.

One of the most practical ways of using HP<->MP is to manipulate you MP as so
that it lands on 7777. When you remove HP<->MP your HP will be 7777, meaning
that the next battle you go into you'll activate All Lucky 7's.

To do this, you must first ensure that your characters MP is maxed out to
9999. Then equip the Shield Materia (or Phoenix Materia), Transform Materia
and a Lv 3 Fire Materia onto that character. Use Shield (or Phoenix) 12
times, to leave you with 7839 MP. Then use Mini to bring it down to 7829,
then finally use Fire3 to bring it down to 7777.

Good Fire based creatures to battle would be the Ark Dragon in the Mythril
Mines, the Bagnadrana in Mt. Corel or the Dragon in Mt. Nibel.

Another use of HP<->MP would be to use it to bring your HP down as to fill
your Limit gauge more quickly, although enemies that use gravity based
attacks such as the Valron's Dive Kick, or the Death Claw's Laser are more
effective ways of filling your Limit bar.

                                                   {Round Island Materia Cave}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.15 D - Round Island Cave


  Round Island is an unmarked location situated on the far north-east corner
of the map. The only Chocobo that can get you to this island is the Gold
Chocobo, and the prize here is the greatest summon of them all - Knights of
The Round. The enemies fought on this island are the Goblins.

                                                        {Knights of The Round}
The Knights of The Round (or KOTR) summon is a total of 13 separate attacks,
and pairing Steal as Well with KOTR would yield 13 steal attempts. Pairing
Quadra Magic with KOTR will not work, unless you were to pair Quadra Magic
with Master Summon, and then Magic Counter with a second Master Summon. This
would give you a small chance of countering with 4x KOTR attacks.

The highest combined damage you can do with KOTR is 129,987 HP (9999 * 13).
Costing 250MP, KOTR is the most expensive spell on the game, and as such a
lot of people tend to pair it with MP Absorb. A character that mimes this
attack will also receive the MP, although using Mime will cost 0MP in the
first place.

The only creatures that will be left standing after using KOTR would be
Emerald WEAPON, Ruby WEAPON and Safer�Sephiroth. KOTR requires the most
amount of AP to master - 500,000. Lasting 1:20, it's safe to say that KOTR is
by far the longest (and strongest) spell on the game.

--E.15 E - Extras


  There are a few extra areas that you can visit once you have bred a
'special' Chocobo:

 LUCRECIA'S CAVE:

Once you have a Green, Black or Gold Chocobo you will be able to visit
Lucrecia's cave which is situated in-between North Corel and Gongaga (or
Corel Prison and Nibelheim). This small lagoon is also accessible via a
submarine, but can take a rather long time to reach given the slow pace of
the sub.

Make sure that Vincent is in your party when you enter the cave. You'll meet
a woman called Lucrecia, and a small scene will play out which teaches you a
little about Vincent's past. You must then fight in 10 battles, after which
you'll be able to return to the cave to receive Vincent's Ultimate Weapon,
the Death Penalty, and his Lv4 Limit Break Manual, Chaos.

 ANCIENT FOREST:

The Ancient Forest is situated slightly east of Cosmo Canyon, and can
initially only be accessed via a Green, Black or Gold Chocobo. Once you have
defeated Ultimate WEAPON (which can be done just after defeating Diamond
WEAPON), the forest will become available to you, but that will be sometime
after you are able to breed Chocobos.

See section D2.10 J for the walkthrough. Notable items of interest here are
the Slash-All Materia, and Cloud's Apocalypse, which is one of two triple
growth weapons.

 OTHER PLACES:

Not that you would need to visit this place on disk 2, but you can also visit
the Sleeping Man's cave near Junon. You can also visit the Great Glacier
again; without a Chocobo you would need to go through the Icicle Inn and then
partake in the snowboarding once more, however with a Green, Black or Gold
Chocobo you'll be able to enter the Great Glacier straight from the entrance.

And that just about wraps up everything that you can do with a Chocobo (other
than racing them, of course)!

--E.16 A - About The WEAPONs


!!SPOILER ALERT!!

  The WEAPONs are creatures that have been created by the planet to protect
itself from dangers that will threaten its very existence, such as Jenova, or
Meteor. They were first created nearly 2000 years ago to destroy Jenova,
although they were never called upon to protect the planet, as the Cetra were
able to subdue and lobotomise Jenova, thereby ending the crisis. Sensing no
impending danger, the WEAPONs lay dormant for two millennia.

When Sephiroth used the Black Materia to summon Meteor, the WEAPONs sensed
imminent danger, and awoke to try to protect the planet from chaos. However,
instead of targeting Sephiroth, they instead headed out to destroy Junon and
Midgar, the main location of the Shinra.

There are five WEAPONs in total, plus an additional two that exist within the
FF VII Universe:

Emerald  - Landed in the ocean, leaving a large crater upon impact. This
           WEAPON was presumably targeting the underwater reactor near Junon,
           although this isn't definite. Emerald is said to be the 2nd hardest
           boss in the game, and can only be fought once you have obtained the
           Submarine. Fighting Emerald isn't mandatory, although it will
           unlock the Emerald WEAPON Trophy.

Ruby     - Landed in the desert near the Gold Saucer, and it is unclear what
           Ruby's intentions are. It appears as a small fin poking out of
           the sand. When you approach it either by Chocobo or in the
           Highwind, it will jump out at you, provoking a battle. Ruby is the
           hardest boss in the game, and isn't compulsory to fight, although
           doing so will unlock the Ruby Trophy.

Ultimate - Landed near Junon, then sets its sights on the small village of
           Mideel. Why? The reason is unknown. You will have one mandatory
           battle with Ultimate before it flies off, not to be seen again
           until later on. When you do see him again, he will be in an
           attacking stance hovering over specific landmarks, namely places
           where reactors are. Defeating him is optional.

Diamond  - Landed in the ocean near the North Crater. Diamond only shows his
           face when the Mako Cannon begins to fire up, and sensing the
           immense amount of Lifestream consumed to power the cannon, he
           emerges from the ocean to destroy Midgar. Diamond is the only
           WEAPON that has to be defeated as per the story line.

Sapphire - Landed in the ocean near Junon. Sapphire is the first WEAPON to go
           on a rampage, setting its sights on the Shinra town of Junon. It
           is the only WEAPON that you do not have to battle, seeing as the
           Mako Cannon will finish the job for you.

Jade     - Is only seen in 'Before Crisis FF VII'. It is an insect-like
           creature, and is the first of the seven WEAPONs to be awakened by
           the planet. When a powerful Summon, Zirconiade, is used, the
           planet senses danger and awakens Jade to deal with it. In the end,
           the Turks were able to defeat Zirconiade, but Jade then decided to
           target the Turks as they were deemed 'too powerful' in the eyes of
           the planet, and needed to be destroyed .

Omega    - Is only seen in 'Dirge of Cerberus FF VII'. It is the supreme
           WEAPON, and will only rear itself if the planet senses imminent
           destruction (which doesn't happen during the course of the game
           we're playing). Its purpose is to gather and seal up all of the
           planets Lifestream, and to then leave the baron planet in search
           of a new home within the galaxy.

It is recommended that you utilise the W-Item glitch whenever going up
against one of the WEAPONs. Using this glitch you will be able duplicate
yourself enough of the necessary items to suit, such as Megalixirs, Hero
Drinks, Dazers etc. See section E.18 B for more info on the W-Item glitch and
how it works.

                                                              {Emerald Weapon}

--E.16 B - Emerald WEAPON


/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\
|>   ABOUT EMERALD WEAPON   <|
\>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</


  Emerald will be found lurking in the depths of the ocean, and can only be
fought once you have obtained the submarine. There will be a 20 minute
countdown timer whilst fighting it, and this can removed using the Underwater
Materia which is obtained from the Kalm Traveller. You must exchange the
Guidebook for it, which can be obtained by morphing a Ghost Ship in the
underwater tunnel leading to the rector underneath Junon.

Whenever you submerge into the ocean, Emerald will have one of 4 locations it
could spawn in. Simply collide into it to battle it. One needs to be
extremely careful when entering/exiting the Sunken Gelnika as Emerald could
be sitting directly outside it! If this happens, submerge then dive and he'll
have spawned somewhere else (1/4 chance).

2 useful tips: Navigating whilst at maximum height will enable you to avoid
               Emerald altogether!
               Emerald and Ruby are both "escapable", so if you do bump
               into Emerald by mistake then you van simply flee (R1 + L1).

Defeating Emerald WEAPON will net you a whopping 50,000 AP, which will triple
to 150,000 if using Cloud's Apocalypse or Cid's Scimitar. This will help
tremendously if you are trying to master all of your Materia. The other thing
that you will obtain upon its defeat is the Earth Harp. You can trade the
Earth harp with the Kalm Traveller for a set of Master Materia!

 NOTE - Emerald is not present in the Japanese original of the game.

                                                      ____________ __________
 Alongside Emerald WEAPON there will be four Eyes    |            |          |
 resting on Emerald's shoulder pads. These Eyes can  |   EMERALD  | EYE X 4  |
 be revived by Emerald, and it will use different    |   WEAPON   |          |
 attacks if its eyes are alive or dead.  ____________|____________|__________|
                                        |            |            |          |
 The most feared move that Emerald will | -------Lv: | 99-------- | 50------ |
 use is Aire Tam Storm, which is        | -------HP: | 1,000,000  | 25000--- |
 actually maTeriA backwards! This move  | -------MP: | 100------- | 100----- |
 will cause 1111 HP to each character   | ------EXP: | 50000----- | -------- |
 per Materia that each character has    | -------AP: | 50000----- | -------- |
 equipped on them. So 9 or more pieces  | ------GIL: | 50000----- | -------- |
 of Materia would result in 9999        | -----DROP: | Earth Harp | -------- |
 damage! The only way to survive this   | ---ABSORB: | ICE--WTR-- | ICE--WTR |
 attack is to equip Final Attack with   | --NULLIFY: | ERT------- | ERT----- |
 Revive, or to equip less than 9 pieces | ----HALVE: | GRV------- | -------- |
 of Materia. That's 9 pieces per        | ---DOUBLE: | LHT------- | FRE----- |
 character, not 9 in total!             | ------ATK: | 180------- | 50------ |
                                        | --MAG ATK: | 180------- | 50------ |
 It is also worth noting the Emerald    | ------DEF: | 180------- | 2------- |
 is Vulnerable to Slow, as well as      | --MAG DEF: | 180------- | 2------- |
 being one of the few bosses on the     | ----DEF %: | 1--------- | 1------- |
 game that doesn't nullify Gravity, so  | DEXTERITY: | 230------- | 150/250- |
 even though Emerald will halve Demi,   | -----LUCK: | 1--------- | 1------- |
 it'll still deal 9999 HP of damage.    |____________________________________|

Avoid casting things such as Haste, Big Guard, Regen etc. as Emerald will
just end up cancelling them out. The reason Emerald is much easier than Ruby
is due the fact that Emerald has a strict pattern in which it'll always
conform to, so you'll always know what's coming.

| 2.) Emerald will then open its four eyes, as well as using Emerald Beam.   |
| 3.) Emerald will now use its eyes to attack you. After 8 attacks, Emerald  |
|     will use Emerald Beam once more.                                       |
| 4.) Emerald will now use its eyes for 4 attacks, after which it will use   |

| 5.) Then it will use its eyes another 4 times, after which it will use     |
|     Emerald Beam.                                                          |
| 6.) Sequence 4 & 5 will repeat themselves until all eyes are destroyed,    |
|     then the pattern will repeat itself from sequence 1.                   |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Revenge Stamp will only be used while its eyes are open, and will be used
every time it takes a hit, unless it has been hit with one of the three
Bahamut Summons or a Limit Break.

Aire Tam Storm will also be used as a counter attack if Revenge Stamp has
been used 10 times, or if his HP is less than 50% after using Knights of The
Round (at least one eye must be open).

/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\
|>   STRATEGIES FOR DEFEATING EMERALD   <|
\>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</

  PREREQUISITE:

There are many strategies for defeating Emerald, and they don't all share the
same level of preparation. The following list is a set of must-haves,
regardless of which strategy you use:

 - Underwater Materia
 - Limit Breaks at full
 - Slow down the Battle Speed to 1/4 or less
 - Time Materia or Spider Web (at the top of the item list) to inflict Slow
 - A healthy stock of Megalixirs
 - All players in the back row
 - Final Attack Materia linked to Revive or Phoenix Materia
 - (Optional) Roughly 12 Hero Drinks, arranged at the top of the Item list
 - (Optional) Sadness inflicted on all 3 characters as to reduce damage taken
 - (Optional) 3 x Sprint Shoes

A Hero Drink will raise ones Atk, Mag Atk, Def and Mag Def by 30%, and can
stack for a total of 100%. These aren't necessary to defeat the WEAPON, but
will help massively. They can be obtained from the Icicle Inn, the North
Crater or as a prize from the Chocobo Square. Spider Webs can be stolen from
the Kimara Bug in Gongaga Jungle.

Also, spending some time in the Sunken Gelnika to farm as many sources as you
can will help out loads. Remember that the Heavy Tank by the reactor in
Gongaga can also drop Power Sources, and it is the only enemy that is
encountered there.

You should probably use your characters Ultimate Weapons, unless you wish to
level up your Materia using the 50,000 AP reward. In terms of armour, I
personally recommend using Wizard Bracelets, but feel free to use the
Mystile, Ziedrich or Imperial Guard if you wish. There is no need to use a
Ribbon against Emerald, so I recommend using Sprint Shoes, failing that
Champion Belts and/or Circlets work a treat.

 NOTE - If you are Lv 99 when fighting Emerald, then Goblin Punch will deal
        9999 damage for 0MP.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 1 - THE 'COUNTER FRENZY' METHOD (Recommended):

With this strategy, you shouldn't actually need the Underwater Materia, I was
able to defeat Emerald in 13 minutes using this method.

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  This is by far the easiest way to defeat Emerald, but also takes the    |
 |  longest to prepare for, and isn't entirely 'necessary'; there are       |
 |  easier and quicker ways to this super boss, keep reading below. This    |
 |  is just my favourite way of taking care of Emerald.                     |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Here is the check list:

 - Mastered Final Attack x 3
 - Mastered Revive x 3 (or Phoenix)
 - Mastered Counter x 4
 - Mastered Deathblow x 4
 - Mastered Counter Attack x 9
 - Mastered Quadra Magic x 2
 - Mastered MP Turbo x 1
 - Mastered Magic Counter x 3
 - Mastered Lightning x 3
 - Mastered Gravity x 2
 - Mastered Contain x 1
 - Mastered Mega All x 3
 - Mastered HP Plus x 3
 - Mastered Magic Plus x 1
 - (Optional) Sprint Shoes x 3

This is the 'Ultimate' list, so don't worry if you don't master all of the
pieces. For example, 2 Mastered Mega Alls will yield a third piece, so you
could get away with mastering one less than the amount stated above
(Lightning and Gravity being the exceptions).


Here is the set-up for this strategy:

  Bear in mind that when you defeat Emerald you will be rewarded with 50,000
  AP, so you may wish to juggle your load out to suit. If you wish to make
  use of the triple growth weapons then you'll probably want to explore the
  other strategies below.

If Player 1's Magic is below 200, then equip him/her with a Circlet to boost
the power of Bolt3. You will not need Ribbons as he cannot inflict any Status
changes upon you (he can just clear them).

Using the Phoenix Materia over the Revive Materia is sometimes advised, as
not only will it completely Revive all fallen teammates, it will also hit
Emerald with Fire damage. The downside is that a level 1 Phoenix can only be
used once per battle, even if the Final Attack is at level 5!

There's no point in casting Big Guard, as Emeralds attacks will negate Big
Guards effect, do however cast Slow on him. All you really need to worry
about is keeping your HP topped up. Try to use three Hero Drinks on each
character. Other than that, this strategy speaks for itself; all you need to
do is sit back and watch as your characters go into a frenzy of counter
attacks every time they are hit. There's nothing else to it! Just keep using
Megalixirs and you'll be fine.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 2 - THE 'LEAST AMOUNT OF WORK' METHOD:

This strategy requires the least amount of preparation, but is also quite a
hard method to accomplish. There is 0 chance of Emerald using Aire Tam Storm
if his eyes are closed. So, the idea is to take out the eyes as quickly as
possible. To do this you are going to want to use your strongest Limit Breaks.

Make sure to have all characters Limit Gauges filled before the battle
begins, you don't need to worry about Final Attack, just be sure to have the
Sprint Shoes equipped to all three characters, and equip yourself with the
strongest load-out you have. Also have all players in Fury, and choose
characters that have Limit Breaks that attack all enemies, such as Barret or
Cid.

Equip yourselves with things such as Lightning, Trine, Laser/Demi, and be
sure to have a suitable replacement for the 'Attack' command as you won't be
using it too often. Magic Counter with Restore is also a good idea. Also,
Mega All and Deathblow go together nicely, perhaps even Added Cut and
Deathblow.

As soon as the battle begins cast Slow on Emerald. The main thing is to save
your Limit Breaks until the eyes have opened. In the meantime, try to consume
as many Hero Drinks as possible (up to 4 per character). A soon as the eyes
open, unleash your Limit Breaks upon them. You will have 3 full turns before
he uses Aire Tam Storm, which should be ample time to destroy the eyes. When
he reverts back to his original state, kick his butt, although this may take
a long time to do so. The best moves to use would be Bolt3, Trine, Demi/Laser
or just simply Deathblow.

When your limits fill back up simply save them for the next time the eyes
open. Just stay away from Knights of The Round and you'll be fine.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 3 - THE 'MIME CHAIN' METHODS:

There are three mime chains that we can perform that will effectively deal
with Emerald. Just remember to have no Counter Attacks, Counters or Magic
Counters equipped when using these strategies (unless intended):

 CHAIN 1 - Mime and Knights of the round

Perhaps the oldest strategy in the book. Master two Mime Materias so that you
have three copies. Simply cast Knights of The Round (after having used a few
Hero Drinks each), then have each character mime the move thereafter. Having
the W-Summon Materia equipped helps also. Pairing KOTR with HP Absorb and/or
MP Absorb is a good idea, or if you wanted to you could use MT Turbo to deal
extra damage. If you do equip HP Absorb, then anyone miming the attack will
also receive HP.

You will need to be mindful of Aire Tam Storm when using this strategy, and
remember that healing/reviving will break the chain, so make sure the KOTR is
higher than Level 1 so that you can re-cast it. Either equip less than 9
pieces of Materia, or set up Final Attack with Revive/Phoenix.

Using this strategy, you can defeat Emerald in 11.5 minutes, if each KOTR hit
was dealing 9999 damage.

 CHAIN 2 - Mime and Quadra Magic with Gravity

Set yourselves one character up with Quadra Magic = Gravity, HP Absorb =
Gravity, MP Absorb = Gravity, W-Magic & Mime. Set the other two characters up
with Mime, and make sure that all of the Gravitys are at least level 3. This
strategy speaks for itself.

Cast Slow, then use 3-4 Hero Drinks each, then just keep miming this combo on
Emerald. Make sure not to equip more than 8 pieces of Materia (unless you
have Final Attack=Revive), and be sure to keep your HP topped up prior to it
using Aire Tam. Remember that healing will break the miming chain.

 CHAIN 3 - Mime and Omnislash

This strategy requires a bit of preparation. First master 7 Mimes and 7
Counters (so you have 8 of each). Then fill up Cloud's Limit bar (making sure
that you have obtained Omnislash), then kill off the other two characters.
Equip the 8 Counters with the Mimes, then save your game.

When you enter into battle, be sure to use Omnislash before Emerald hits you.
Then just sit back and watch as Cloud unleashes 8 uses of Omnislash against
Emerald every time he is hit. It's unlikely, but you may need to break the
chain to heal, although by that time your Limit should have filled back up.
Inflict yourself with Fury just to be safe.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 4 - THE '7777' METHOD:

This is probably the most fun method of all. Equip each character with HP
Plus and one other Materia of your choice. I suggest KOTR and Mime x 2. The
idea is to keep your HP topped up at 9999, then when Emerald uses Aire Tam
Storm, your HP will be dropped by 2222 bringing it to 7777, activating All
Lucky Seven's. This will deal 64 hits * 7777 = 487,728 HP.

OK, so it isn't enough to take out even half of Emeralds HP, but it is enough
to give you a fighting chance, whilst also looking super-cool in the process.
The easiest way to get Emerald to use Aire Tam is to wait until it has opened
its eyes, then kill off three of them, leaving a yellow one alive. Then just
wait, after using Emerald Beam twice it'll use Aire Tam; just be sure to keep
your HP topped up at all times. Don't attack it whilst waiting for Aire Tam
as he'll likely counter with Revenge Stomp, and this could mess things up for
you.

You'll still have to do a fair bit yourself, that's what KOTR and Mime is
for. And no, you cannot activate 7777 Fever twice in one round, although if
you do land on 7777 HP for a second time then all of your attacks and healing
spells will deliver 7777 HP! I was able to defeat Emerald this way in roughly
15 minutes, meaning there is no need to equip the Underwater Materia.

time, visit section E.18


Strategy 5 & 6 for Emerald are the exact same as strategy 5 & 6 for Ruby.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 5 - THE 'ONE HIT' METHODS:

There are two ways in which you can defeat Emerald in one hit. One of them is
legit. The other isn't so legit.

 METHOD 1 - Cait Sith's 'Game Over'

Use QSI Link [Slots] to learn how to manipulate Cait Sith's Slots to achieve
the desired outcome. If you have mastered the art of manipulating the reels
then you'll be able to land on three Cait Siths, which will result in the
'Game Over' attack. Although this strategy could take a while to get the hang
of, it could save you a lengthy amount of time in the long run, as this
method requires no mastered Materia.

Game Over will kill all enemy instantly, ignoring all Death immunities. The
only other spell in the game that ignores Death immunity is Cait Sith's
'Death Joker' (Cait Sith - Cait Sith - BAR), which will kill all allies
instantly, unless they are attacking from different sides.

 METHOD 2 - Barret or Vincent's' 'Overflow Glitch':

To activate 'Overflow' for Barret, you must first max out his Strength to 255
by farming for Power Sources from the Heavy Tank in Gongaga. Then make sure
he is Lv 99. You can either equip 3,340,000 AP on his weapon (Mastered KOTR =
500,000 AP) for the least effort in-battle, or 1,410,000 for the most amount
of effort in-battle.

If you go for the 1,410,000 AP route, then bear-in-mind you will only have a
chance of causing damage overflow; equip 1,500,000 to guarantee overflow.

Enter into battle. If you equipped Barret with 3,340,000 AP then all you'll
need to do is use 2 Hero Drinks, then attack and Emerald will be killed in 1
hit. If you went for the lower AP value, then you'll need to cast 4 Hero
Drinks, Be in Berserk and also land a Critical. If you don't mind using 4
Hero Drinks but you don't want to have to use Berserk and Critical, then
you'll need to equip him with 2,120,000 AP.

For Vincent, you must first need to kill 59,520 enemies for the easiest
possible in-battle method (just 1 Hero Drink), or 16,896 for the longest in-
battle method (as well as being Lv 99 and having 255 Attack). 16,896 will
only give you a small chance of overflowing; kill 18,048 to guarantee it! 4
hero Drink, Critical & Berserk are needed; if you just wanted to use 4 Hero
Drinks without Crit and Bers then you'll need 25,984 kills!

When causing overflow be sure that there are no negative damage modifiers
in=play, such as Back Row or Slash-All.

The glitch occurs because during the damage calculation process, a value has
exceeded 2,147,483,647. When this happens, the number is then flipped into a
negative number which means you are causing negative damage to the enemy, and
the games natural presumption is that you have dealt enough damage to kill
the enemy, and by default it will then kill it for you.

For a closer look at exactly why Overflow occurs, refer to section E.18 or
use QSI Link [DAMAGE OVERFLOW GLITCH].

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 6 - THE 'NO BUTTON NECESSARY' METHOD:

                                          (Thanks to Death_Unites_Us for this)
Equip the following:
Final Attack=Revive, Final Attack=KOTR, Final Attack=KOTR, HP Plus, HP<->MP.

Now use an Elixir. Make sure that all three Final Attacks and both KOTR are
mastered, this won't work otherwise.

Get into battle. Make a cup of tea. Watch the TV for a bit. Come back.
Victory.

                                                                 {Ruby Weapon}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.16 C - Ruby WEAPON


/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\
|>   ABOUT RUBY WEAPON   <|
\>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</


  Ruby WEAPON will only be available to fight once you have defeated Ultimate
WEAPON, *AND* have fought in one random battle. This can be as early as the
Midgar re-visited section (or prior to). To find Ruby, you must head over to
the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer; here you will see a small red fin
poking out of the ground. Should you collide into it either with the Highwind
or a Chocobo, Ruby will jump out at you, initiating a battle. Ruby is said to
be the hardest boss on the game, and defeating it will reward you with the
Ruby WEAPON Trophy.

As with Emerald, defeating Ruby will net you a staggering 50,000 AP! This can
be tripled to 150,000 using a triple growth weapon. Upon its defeat, you will
receive the Desert Rose, which can be traded with the Kalm Traveller for a
Gold Chocobo. This Chocobo is completely useless in the races, and it's
recommended that you obtain a Chocobo the 'normal' way, as a Gold Chocobo
that has been bred will be a much better racing Chocobo.

 NOTE - Ruby is not present in the Japanese original of the game. Also, you
        can flee from the Ruby battle just as you could Emerald, unless the
        Tentacles are buried, in which case you would have to destroy them to
        be able to escape.

 Ruby is extremely tough, and unlike Emerald it | RUBY WEAPON  |    RUBY'S   |
 does not have a fixed sequence of attacks that |              | TENTACLE x2 |

 completely impervious to all      | -------Lv: | 59---------- | 37--------- |

 susceptible to damage. Because of | ----DEF %: | 100--------- | 100-------- |
 this, it is recommended that you  | DEXTERITY: | 253--------- | 253-------- |
 enter into battle with two        | -----LUCK: | 10---------- | 10--------- |
 characters K.O'd.                 |_________________________________________|

When Ruby has its tentacles buried, you should revive your other two players.
*Do not* then destroy the two tentacles, as doing so would provoke Ruby to
take them out of the ground, and although she would not become invincible
again, she would be programmed to use Whirlsand until one character is either
left alive/in-play, and it would not bury its tentacles again until this had
happened.

Ribbons are mandatory when fighting Ruby, as its tentacles can inflict some
nasty Status changes upon you on every attack. It's also handy to know that
the tentacles themselves cannot kill you as all of their attacks are % based.
Unlike the eyes of Emerald, the Tentacles of Ruby are *not* independent; the
moves that they cast on you come from Ruby itself (meaning that there is just
one ATB gauge for all three targets).

When the battle begins, the game will register that a 'back attack' is in
play, and the first time your players are hit they will be hit for x2 damage.
Tapping L1 & R1 will not negate this effect.

The best way to defeat Ruby is to exploit its weaknesses - Slow and Paralyze.
Remember that Ruby has the highest Dexterity of any creature in the game, so
casting Slow is essential. It also has ridiculously high Defence and Magic .

|                                                                            |
| BEFORE BURYING TENTACLES:                                                  |
|                                                                            |
| 1.) If one character is alive when the battle begins, Ruby will bury it's  |
|     tentacles immediately.                                                 |
| 2.) If 2 or more characters are alive when the battle begins then Ruby     |
|     will use Big Claw, Big Swing, Whirlsand, Big Claw, Big Swing,          |
|     Whirlsand.                                                             |
| 3.) If you fall down to one party member within those 6 turns, Ruby will   |
|     bury its tentacles immediately.                                        |
| 4.) If you fall down to one character after those 6 turns, Ruby will not   |
|     bury its tentacles until after its 15th turn. During that time it will |
|     use:                                                                   |
|       1/3 - Big Claw                                                       |
|       1/3 - Big Swing                                                      |
|       1/3 - Comet 2                                                        |
| 5.) After the 15th turn, Ruby will use:                                    |
|       1/5 - Bury Tentacles                                                 |
|       1/5 - Big Claw                                                       |
|       1/5 - Big Swing                                                      |
|       2/5 - Comet 2                                                        |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

So basically, if Ruby completes its cycle of using 2 Whirlsands, you could
end up waiting a fairly long time for it to eventually bury its tentacles. If
at any point you do destroy the tentacles, Ruby will resort back to sequence
two until one character remains. It will then resort to sequence three, four
or five, respectively (depending on what turn you're on).

If you were to attack Ruby with its tentacles un-buried, then it will counter
with Whirlsand provided that there is more than one player left alive/in-play.

|  NOTE - The act of digging its tentacles counts as 1 turn.                 |
|                                                                            |
| 1.) Between turns 1 - 10, Ruby will use:                                   |
|       1/4 Ruby Flame                                                       |

|       1/4 Left Revenge                                                     |
|       1/4 Right Revenge                                                    |
| 2.) Between turns 11 - 24, Ruby will use:                                  |
|       1/6 - Ruby Flame                                                     |

|       1/6 - Shadow Flare                                                   |
|       1/6 - Ultima                                                         |
|       1/6 - Left Revenge                                                   |
|       1/6 - Right Revenge                                                  |
| 3.) On the 25th turn Ruby will use Whirlsand if there are 3 players        |
|     alive/in-play.                                                         |
| 4.) After turn 25, Ruby will use:                                          |
|       2/12 - Ruby Flame                                                    |
|       2/12 - Ruby Ray                                                      |
|       2/12 - Shadow Flare                                                  |
|       2/12 - Ultima                                                        |
|       1/12 - Right Thrust                                                  |
|       1/12 - Right Revenge                                                 |
|       1/12 - Left Thrust                                                   |
|       1/12 - Left Revenge                                                  |
| 5.) On the 32nd turn Ruby will use Whirlsand if there are 2 or 3 players   |
|     alive/in play. Ruby will then continue using the moves in sequence 4.  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

With the tentacles are buried, Ruby will always counter using either Right
Thrust or Left Thrust (50% chance) against any attack. If KOTR was cast
(while its tentacles were buried), then it will retaliate by using Ultima.

/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\
|>   STRATEGIES FOR DEFEATING RUBY   <|
\>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</

  PREREQUISITE:

The following is a list of must-haves prior to engaging Ruby:

 - 3 x Ribbons
 - 2 x K.O'd characters
 - At least 12 x Dazers, Megalixirs and Hero Drinks
 - 1 x Spider Web (or Time Lv 2)
 - Limit Break at full
 - Final Attack Materia linked to Revive or Phoenix Materia
 - Battle Speed set to 0 and ATB set to Wait

Dazers are used to inflict Paralyze and can be stolen from the Battery Caps
in the forest near Nibelheim, or from the Boundfat in Corral Valley. The
Spider Web is used to inflict Slow and can be stolen from the Kimara Bug in
Gongaga Jungle. Remember that the Slow status will prolong the Paralyze
Status, so be sure to use the Spider Web first. Also make sure to slow the
Battle Speed down all the way, and also be sure to arrange your battle items
to the top of the inventory list.

I would personally recommend using your characters Ultimate Weapons, however
if you are looking to gain the huge AP reward then feel free to use
alternative 'normal growth' weapons. In terms of armour, I suggest the Fire
Armlet to help with the Ruby Flame attack, although anything such as the
Mystile, Ziedrich or Imperial Guard will suffice (you could even use the
Wizard Bracelet, just remember that it has low Defence stats).

If your character's defences aren't high enough then you may find yourselves
getting eradicated by Shadow Flare or Ultima. To avoid this, use Hero Drinks,
Barriers, MBarriers, Dragon Force and Wall. You can even use Reflect to
counter Shadow Flare if you wish. Also, 26 uses of Magic Hammer will deplete
its MP entirely, rendering Ultima and Shadow Flare unusable.

 NOTE - Ruby is also vulnerable to Darkness, although Darkness will have no
        effect whatsoever on any enemy, as Darkness will only affect commands
        that are used by ourselves. It is possible to inflict Ruby with Fury,
        although doing so seems to have no effect. Use QSI Link [Fury] to
        find out how to inflict Fury on an enemy.

  STRATEGY 1 - THE 'KOTR' METHOD (Recommended):

This method probably takes the longest to prepare for, but is also the
easiest (and oldest) strategy for taking care of Ruby. Here is the Materia
check-list:

 - MP Turbo x 1 (Mastered)
 - Knights of The Round x 1 (Mastered)
 - Mime x 2 (Mastered)
 - W-Summon x 1
 - W-Item x 1
 - HP Plus x 3 (Mastered)
 - Final Attack x 1 (minimum)
 - Revive x 1 (minimum)
 - Mega All x 1
 - (Optional) Mastered Magic Plus
 - (Optional) Sneak Attack (with Time Lv2)

All figures are exact; if I state 2 x mastered Mimes it's because I intend
for you to have 3. Also, seeing as not much Materia is required for this
strategy I suggest filling your slots up with Materia that you wish to gain
50,000AP. Here is the Load-Out I recommend:

Before going into battle be sure to have filled up player 2's Limit all the
way, slow down the Battle Speed to 0, and place your Dazers, Spider Web, and
Megalixirs at the top of the inventory list. Then kill off players 1 & 3.

The level of the Time Materia is up to you; at level 1 the player will cast
Haste on themselves as soon the battle begins enabling you to revive the
other two players faster, whereas a level 2 Time will cast Slow on Ruby,
eliminating the need for the Spider Web. Both strategies have their
advantages. When you are ready to battle Ruby, head over the Gold Saucer Area
then save your game.

As soon as the battle begins (and after Ruby has buried its tentacles),
revive the two KO'd players. The Mega All should see them both revived in one
fell swoop. Also, if you had a Lv 2 Time with Sneak Attack then Ruby would
already be slowed. If not, use player 3 to W-Item Spider Web and Dazers to
Slow and Paralyze Ruby. Then cast Big Guard from Player 1, followed by player
2's Limit Break.

You can now use a few Hero Drink on each character if you wish, just remember
that you're going to want to kill Ruby within 25 turns, otherwise it will use
Whirlsand thereby removing one of your players from battle, and a removed
player will not receive any battle rewards.

Now have player one cast W-Summon KOTR. Combined with the Magic Plus and MP
Turbo, the players attacks should be hitting for 9999 damage (or there
abouts) with every attack. The HP Absorb will save you from having to break
the Mime chain to restore your HP, and the only time that you will need break
the chain is if Ruby breaks free of its paralysis. After 7 uses of KOTR, Ruby
should start flashing red. Congratulations!

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 2 - THE 'I DON'T LIKE USING KOTR' METHOD:

This is a much, much tougher strategy than the KOTR method, but also takes
much less time to prepare for. You're going to want to equip your strongest
magic, such as Quadra Magic = Comet 2/Ultima, Sneak Attack = Time Lv 2 works
well, W-Magic, Mime etc. Also be sure to have obtained the Enemy Skill Magic
Hammer, and make sure that you have the W-Item Materia equipped. Lastly,
equip a level 2 Throw.

As a precautionary, you could equip Elemental with Fire/Ifrit to protect you
from Ruby Flame (or a Fire Armlet), but it won't be too necessary. Ribbons
are mandatory, but everything else is optional; for real protection try using
the Ziedrich. Although it has no Materia slots, it will halve all incoming
damage!

As before, fill player 2's Limit, kill off players 1 & 3, slow the Battle
Speed down to 0, set the ATB to wait and arrange your inventory as so that
the Dazers and Megalixirs are at the top.

When the battle begins, do exactly as you would've done in the first
strategy; Revive the other two players, then cast Spider Web and Dazers
followed by Big Guard. Now it's just a case of simply throwing down
everything you've got! Every other turn have the W-Item holder use Dazers and
a Megalixir, and you should be completely safe. If Ruby does break free of
Paralysis, then you should be Ok so long as your HP was topped up to begin
with.

 NOTE - If you use Dazers on a Paralyzed Ruby, the Status will *not* reset;
        you must wait for her to break free first. With Ruby in Slow and your
        characters in Haste, you should get 3-4 turns in before she breaks
        free.

One way to deal with Ruby's Shadow Flare and Ultima attacks would be to use
Magic Hammer 9 times per character; this would see its MP drained to 0. This
would leave Ruby only being able to use its tentacles, Ruby Flame and Ruby
Ray! Just remember that you do have to kill it within 25 turns, or it'll cast
Whirlsand on you, so if you do plan on doing this then forget about using
Hero Drinks.

Another way to deal with Ruby's Ultima, Comet 2 and Shadow Flare attacks
would be to inflict Ruby with Fury, thereby dropping her accuracy by 30%.
This is a very risky strategy, as you would need to have one player enter the
battle *without* a Ribbon equipped; the only way to cast Fury on an enemy is
to cast 'Confu' on an ally, then have that ally use a Hyper before the
Confusion takes effect. If done correctly, Ruby will be the one to be
inflicted with Fury, and you'll then need to cure the ally of Confusion. Then
either cast Resist (Lv 3 Heal) or use a Vaccine to grant that ally
invulnerability to Status changes, just bear in mind that if the player
already has a negative Status in place, then the Resist Status would 'lock'
that negative Status in place.

Finally, you can use the 'Coin' command to throw 99,000 gil at Ruby for 9999
damage. This will ignore all defences (but not invulnerability). Seeing as
you'll start at 600,000 gil, you'll have to bring the gil down manually to
99,000 as to not waste gil, and the main problem with that is that the ATB
will not be set to wait, meaning Ruby will hit you during this time. So, to
speed things up a little you may have to consider just throwing 600,000 gil a
pop! The best way to farm gil is to sell mastered Alls or by selling Sylkis
Greens using the W-Item Glitch.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 3 - THE 'ALL LUCKY SEVEN'S' METHOD

Ok so this strategy is a combination of the previous two strategies, plus
this time you'll be activating 7777 Fever, which will take out over half of
Ruby's health before Ruby has done anything other than dig its tentacles in
the ground! Here's how:-

Before killing off any of your characters, you're going to want to get your
chosen characters HP to 7767. There are various methods in which you can do
this, use QSI Link [Lucky 7's] to view the % chart that will bring you to
7767 the quickest (credit to James Baxter).

If you don't wish to jump from this section then here is an alternative (and
slightly longer) method:

 NOTE - Have the chosen players Limit bar filled before setting this up! Also
        make sure that the players Limit Break is one that attacks multiple
        times.

Equip the chosen character with Manipulate, one with Enemy Skill that has
Goblin Punch, and one with Goblin Punch and Transform (or 2x Shrivel). Make
sure not to have Mega-All or Slash-All, and don't have any Limit Breaks
filled (other than the chosen character). You must then bring the chosen
player's HP down to below 7777; you can do that quite easily by equipping
then un-equipping HP<->MP.

You're then ready to enter into battle; kill off all but one enemy which (you
guessed it) you can then manipulate. Have the two characters that aren't
manipulating inflicted with Mini. You'll then find that Goblin Punch will
deal precisely 8 HP of damage, provided that your characters are the same
level as each other; if not then it'll just deal 1HP of damage per hit. It
may take a while, but you can then keep attacking the chosen player until
their HP lands on xx77. When this happens simply flee from battle.

Now using Hi-Potions and Potions bring that characters HP to 7677. Save the
game and swap the chosen character out of your party. Now it's time to kill
off your other two characters, then slow the Battle Speed right down and
arrange your inventory so that Dazers and Megalixirs (and Spider Webs if
you're not using Time) are at the top, along with a Potion this time. Swap
your chosen character back into your party and equip you Materia and armoury
according to which of the first two strategies you prefer.

When the battle begins, Ruby will dig its tentacles into the ground. As soon
as this happens, unleash your Limit Break on the tentacles, thereby un-
burying them. Then feed the character a Potion (and throw Dazers if W-Item is
equipped) to bring his/her HP to 7777. Sit back, relax, and enjoy as you hit
Ruby for a total of 497,728 HP. If you had activated 7777 Fever whilst the
tentacles were still buried, then you wouldn't have hit Ruby with all 64
attacks, as the tentacles themselves would likely have be targeted.

Provided that both characters are still KO'd, and it is before turn 6, Ruby
will automatically dig her tentacles back in the ground. After reviving the
fallen two players, you can then use Dazers, Big Guard and Hero Drinks,
followed by whichever ass-whooping tactics you desire. Bye-bye Ruby.

 NOTE - The 64 attacks from All Lucky 7's classes as one turn.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 4 - THE '1 MAN, 5 MATERIA' METHOD:

This is one of the quickest and most simplistic ways of defeating Ruby, and
there are slight variations on how this can be performed. What makes this
strategy so effective is that all of your Materia can be at level 1. Equip
the following:

W-Summon, Hades, HP Absorb = Knights Of The Round & Mime. A cheeky Magic Plus
and HP Plus wouldn't go amiss, either.

Open with Hades which will Paralyze Ruby, then follow with KOTR. Ruby will
not counter with Ultima because it will be Paralyzed, and you will not need
KOTR to be higher than level 1 because Mime can be used countless times,
costing 0 MP. The only thing you would need to worry about is the one attack
that Ruby will be able to throw in every so often; as long as you can survive
this attack you should be fine, as KOTR will heal your HP if paired with HP
Absorb.

An adaptation of this strategy would be to revive your players at the last
hurdle, as so that they receive all of the battle spoils. To do this, you
would have to have KOTR at level 2, and also to have the Phoenix Materia
equipped. On the last use of KOTR, instead of using Mime you can W-Summon
Phoenix to revive your fallen comrades, then KOTR to finish it off. Make sure
to have at least 830MP when going into battle.

You need to know how many uses of KOTR are required to finish it off:

 Between 8792 - 9999 HP per attack - 7  uses of KOTR
 Between 7693 - 8791 HP per attack - 8  uses of KOTR
 Between 6838 - 7692 HP per attack - 9  uses of KOTR
 Between 6154 - 6837 HP per attack - 10 uses of KOTR
 Between 5595 - 6153 HP per attack - 11 uses of KOTR

 Variable - Hades will damage Ruby for no more than 500HP, even with 255
            Magic, and Phoenix will heal Ruby by no more than 500; so the
            above figures won't be exact, although but they won't be too far
            off at all.


Strategy 5 & 6 for Ruby are the exact same as strategy 5 & 6 for Emerald
(excluding damage overflow).

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 5 - THE 'ONE HIT' METHODS:

There are two ways in which you can defeat Ruby in one hit. One of them is
legit. The other isn't so legit.

 METHOD 1 - Cait Sith's 'Game Over'

Use QSI Link [Slots] to learn how to manipulate Cait Sith's Slots to achieve
the desired outcome. If you have mastered the art of manipulating the reels
then you'll be able to land on three Cait Siths, which will result in the
'Game Over' attack. Although this strategy could take a while to get the hang
of, it could save you a lengthy amount of time in the long run, as this
method requires no mastered Materia.

Game Over will kill all enemy instantly, ignoring all Death immunities (but
not invincibility). The only other spell in the game that ignores Death
immunity is Cait Sith's 'Death Joker' (Cait Sith - Cait Sith - BAR), which
will kill all allies instantly, unless they are attacking from different
sides.

 METHOD 2 - Barret or Vincent's' 'Overflow Glitch':

NEITHER BARRET NOR VINCENT CAN OVERFLOW AGAINST RUBY! It is the one enemy in
the game that Vincent cannot overflow against.

For a closer look at exactly why, refer to section E.18 or use QSI Link
[DAMAGE OVERFLOW GLITCH].

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  STRATEGY 6 - THE 'NO BUTTON NECESSARY' METHOD:

                                          (Thanks to Death_Unites_Us for this)
Equip the following:
Final Attack=Revive, Final Attack=KOTR, Final Attack=KOTR, HP Plus, HP<->MP.

Now use an Elixir. Make sure that all three Final Attacks and both KOTR are
mastered, this won't work otherwise.

Get into battle. Make a cup of tea. Watch the TV for a bit. Come back.
Victory.

                                                             {Ultimate Weapon}
������������������������������������������������������������������������������
--E.16 D - Ultimate WEAPON


/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\
|>   ABOUT ULTIMATE WEAPON   <|
\>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</


  Ultimate WEAPON is the first WEAPON in the game that you fight, and is a
mandatory battle whilst visiting Mideel. During this battle, Ultimate will
flee after using 3 attacks. Battling him is completely optional thereafter,
and he will not appear until you have defeated Diamond WEAPON towards the end
of Disk 2. Defeating it unlocks the Ultimate WEAPON Trophy.

 NOTE - Be sure to steal the acclaimed Curse Ring from the Mideel encounter.

When you are ready to fight Ultimate, you will find him hovering above the
crater near Junon. Collide into him to fight him. After 4 turns, he will flee
from the battle as he did in Mideel. You must then chase him in the Highwind
as he flies off in random directions, and colliding into him 4 or 5 times
will make him fly to one of 7 different locations around the map. Depending
on the location he goes to, the fight will either be a ground battle or an
aerial battle. Remember to use long ranged players, or the Long Range Materia
when fighting Ultimate in the air:

 Near Gongaga      - Ground Battle
 Near Fort Condor  - Ground Battle
 Near Midgar       - Ground Battle
 North Crater      - Ground Battle
 Near Junon        - Aerial Battle
 Near Mideel       - Aerial Battle
 Near North Corel  - Aerial Battle
 Near Cosmo Canyon - Final, Aerial Battle.

After each battle, be sure to quickly view which direction Ultimate flew off
in. If you lose track of it then it can be a real pain in the backside to
find again.

Once Ultimate's HP is low enough he will head over to Cosmo Canyon, there you
will have your final battle with Ultimate WEAPON. Once he has been defeated
he will drop Cloud's Ultimate Weapon, the Ultima Weapon, he'll then crash
into the cliff face near Cosmo Canyon which will allow you to gain access to
the Ancient Forest. This forest was previously accessible via a Green, Black
or Gold Chocobo. Defeating Ultimate will also trigger Ruby's appearance,
however you must fight in one random battle first.

If you do intend on defeating Ultimate prior to the Midgar events, then be
very careful when searching for Ultimate as flying over the North Crater,
then Midgar (respectively) will trigger the point-of-no-return for Disk 2.
Also, if you finish a battle with Ultimate, and he is no-where to be seen,
then there stands a good chance that he has spawned back at the crater near
Junon.

 NOTE - Ultimate is vulnerable to Slow.

 section E.14.                                  |____________________________|

 UPDATE - If you deplete all of Ultimate's HP in the first fight, then you'll
          still have to fight it in the crater near Junon first before it'll
          flee off to Cosmo Canyon. Thanks to Aerinhikari for the correction.

While most of Ultimate's stats are fixed, it will have varying things that
can be stolen from it. Curse Ring aside, these items can be stolen more than
once (1 per battle):

Mideel Battle - Curse Ring
Aerial Battle - Circlet
Ground Battle - Reflect Ring

Lastly, Ultimate will use an attack called Ultima Beam, which is the only
attack in the game that uses the 'Hidden' element (that causes physical
damage). To protect yourself from Hidden, simply pair the Elemental Materia
to any 'non-elemental' Materia, excluding Restore and every Support Materia.
If done correctly, you will halve/nullify/absorb the Ultima Beam attack. An
example of this set-up would be Elemental=HP Plus.

 NOTE - Ultimate will not use Shadow Flare until the final battle above Cosmo
        Canyon.

Here was my load-out going into the following fights, bearing in mind that
it's worth swapping your weapons from 0 growth weapons to double or even
triple growth weapons for the final fight. This load-out does not apply to
the first battle:

 1) Cloud  (Back Row)
                                                                       MP Plus
    Heaven's Sword - Ultima, Contain, Enemy Skill, Long Range, Magic Plus,
    Shinra Alpha   - Elemental=HP Plus, All=Restore, Sneak Attack=Mug
    Sneak Gloves

 2) Yuffie  (Back Row)
                                                                Revive, Typoon
    Conformer      - Enemy Skill, Double Cut, MP Turbo=Comet, All=Barrier,
    Crystal Bangle - Elemental=HP Plus, Steal, Counter Attack, MP Plus,
    Champion Belt                                                 Bahamut Zero

 3) Vincent  (Back Row)
                                                    Speed Plus, Counter Attack
    Death Penalty - Steal as Well=Steal, All=Time, Enemy Skill, Mime,
    Shinra Alpha  - Elemental=HP Plus, Added Cut=Deathblow, Luck Plus, MP Plus
    Champion Belt

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  FIRST FORM - MIDEEL                                     (Steal - Curse Ring)

There is no need for extensive preparation for this battle as it will only
last three turns. Ultimate will use Quake2, Claw (unnamed attack) and then
Ultima Beam before finally fleeing from battle. Be sure to steal the Curse
Ring before this happens, as there are only two places in the game that you
can acquire these bad-boys, and this is one of them. If you take out more
than 20,000 HP, Ultimate will flee.

Just make sure to have Steal equipped, and also to have protection from the
Hidden element. There's really not much else to this battle, other than the
fact that the more HP you drain from it now, the less HP he'll have in the
forthcoming battles. Again, if you were to use KOTR in this battle then the
next two battles would be the final battles.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  SECOND FORM - AERIAL                                       (Steal - Circlet)

When fighting the aerial form of Ultimate, it will also gain immunity to
Earth and Water. The following locations will provoke an aerial fight:

 Near Junon        - Aerial Battle
 Near Mideel       - Aerial Battle
 Near North Corel  - Aerial Battle

Whenever you encounter Ultimate in this form you'll be able to steal a
Circlet from it, so try to obtain 3 in total. Remember that these are also
steal-able from the Snow in the Great Glacier, which *is* re-
visitable.

As with the previous battle, Ultimate will have a fixed set of commands that
it will use before escaping - Ultima Beam, Thunderball (unnamed attack),
Ultima Beam and finally Thunderball again. It will always flee on its fifth
turn, unless you have knocked off 20,000 HP, whichever comes first.

Having long ranged players here is mandatory, or failing that the Long Rang
Materia. Remember that your steal attempts will be voided otherwise.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  THIRD FORM - GROUND                                   (Steal - Reflect Ring)

The following locations will provoke a ground battle with Ultimate:

 Near Gongaga      - Ground Battle
 Near Fort Condor  - Ground Battle
 Near Midgar       - Ground Battle
 North Crater      - Ground Battle

Always make sure to steal a Reflect Ring as there is only one Reflect Ring
available besides Ultimate, so try to steal two before the final fight. I
recommend saving before each battle, if you don't successfully steal then
just re-load your save.

There is absolutely no need to swap your load out from the previous set-up,
as these fights are short and sweet. Ultimate's attacks will be Claw (unnamed
attack), Ultima Beam, Claw, Quake2 then flee, unless you deal 20,000 HP, in
which case it'll flee straight away. Note the Midgar Battle background is the
same as the one when you fought Motor Ball on the Midgar Highway.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  FOURTH FORM - FINAL BATTLE

Once Ultimate's HP has dropped to below 20,000, it will makes its way
immediately over to Cosmo Canyon after the previous battle. If you managed to
deplete its HP to 0 in that battle, then the final fight will be fought with
20,000 HP, otherwise its HP will be whatever it was from the previous fight.
Remember that this is also an aerial battle, so it'll be immune to Earth and
Water again.

You should think about equipping all Enemy Skill Materias onto one character,
along with the Reflect ring. The reason being is the fact that Ultimate will
retaliate upon death with the Enemy Skill Shadow Flare, and you won't be able
to obtain it again until Disk 3 (which won't be too far away). Also, Shadow
Flare can be reflected whilst still learning the Enemy Skill, so equip the
Reflect ring onto that character.

You will receive the battle rewards for defeating Ultimate in this battle, so
it's worth swapping your load out to suit. Also, there are no steal-able
items, so you don't need to worry about equipping the Steal Materia. Here is
my recommended load-out:

 1) Cloud  (Back Row)

    Apocalypse     - Double Cut, Your choice...
    Crystal Bangle - Enemy Skill, Enemy Skill, Enemy Skill, Enemy Skill,
    Reflect Ring                                               All=Restore

 2) Yuffie  (Back Row)

    Rising Sun  - Sneak Attack=Deathblow, Luck Plus, Speed Plus
    Rune Armlet - Your choice...
    Champion Belt

 3) Cid  (Back Row)

    Scimitar    - Your choice...
    Rune Armlet - Comet, Contain, Slash-All, Counter Attack
    Champion Belt

 NOTE - To obtain the Apocalypse prior to defeating Ultimate you must first
        have obtain a 'special' Chocobo to gain early access to the Ancient
        Forest.

Ultimate's attack pattern is constant - it will have a 50% chance of using
Ultima Beam and a 50% chance of using Thunderball. Make sure that the Enemy
Skill carrier is the person to deliver the final blow as Shadow Flare will be
used on the last person to attack it.

Once it has been defeated you will be rewarded with Cloud's Ultima Weapon,
which is a necessary item to have obtained if you to take part in the
optional battle at the Battle Arena, along with the W-Summon Materia and
Omnislash (both of which are obtained from the Battle Square). The prize for
winning the special battle will be the Final Attack Materia.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

                  Manipulate, Deathblow, Morph, Throw, Sense and Steal.

      Suggested:- MP Absorb = Ultima / Comet / Deathblow / Morph / Mug /
                  Steal / KOTR

                  If the enemy has no MP then you cannot absorb MP from it.
                  nearly a quarter of all enemies have 0 MP, however all but
                  5 of them are encountered on Disk 1.

                  Lv2 = 40%, Lv3 = 60%, Lv4 = 80%, Lv5 = 100%.
      Suggested:- Magic Counter = Ultima / Comet / Restore

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 COUNTER = COMMAND
 ^^^^^^^
   Combine with:- Master Command, Mime, Manipulate, Deathblow, Morph, Throw,
                  Sense and Steal.
         Effect:- Chance of countering with paired Materia. Lv1 = 30%,

                  Transform, Mystify, Seal, Revive, Heal, Restore, Lightning,
                  Earth, Ice and Fire.

                  Lv1 = 1 use per battle, Lv5 = 5 uses per battle.
      Suggested:- All = Time / Barrier / Heal / Restore

                  Whilst in the "Magic" menu outside of battle you can use
                  Restore on all players when Restore is paired with All.
                  Press R1 to toggle the effects of All when selecting a
                  party member to heal.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 ADDED EFFECT = MAGIC / SUMMON
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
* = recommended

*ADDED EFFECT = CONTAIN   - Adds Status:- Confusion, Stop and Petrify
 ADDED EFFECT = DESTRUCT  - Adds Status:- Death
*ADDED EFFECT = TIME      - Adds Status:- Slow and Stop
 ADDED EFFECT = TRANSFORM - Adds Status:- Frog and Small
 ADDED EFFECT = MYSTIFY   - Adds Status:- Confusion and Berserk
*ADDED EFFECT = SEAL      - Adds Status:- Sleep and Silence
 ADDED EFFECT = POISON    - Adds Status:- Poison
 ADDED EFFECT = ODIN      - Adds Status:- Death
 ADDED EFFECT = CHOCO/MOG - Adds Status:- Stop
*ADDED EFFECT = HADES     - Adds Status:- Sleep, Poison, Confusion, Silence,
                                          Frog and Small

If paired on one's Weapon, then the following Statuses will have a 20% chance
of being inflicted upon the enemy when attacking.
If paired on one's Armour, then the following Statuses will be defended
against.

A large number of enemies are vulnerable to Slow and Stop, which is why the
Added Effect=Time combo is recommended until you obtain the Contain and Hades
Materia. The next best thing after Time is Seal.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 ELEMENTAL = MAGIC / SUMMON
 ^^^^^^^^^
* = recommended

 ELEMENTAL = GRAVITY   - Adds Element:- Gravity
 ELEMENTAL = POISON    - Adds Element:- Poison
 ELEMENTAL = LIGHTNING - Adds Element:- Lightning
 ELEMENTAL = EARTH     - Adds Element:- Earth
 ELEMENTAL = ICE       - Adds Element:- Ice
 ELEMENTAL = FIRE      - Adds Element:- Fire
 ELEMENTAL = TYPOON    - Adds Element:- Wind
 ELEMENTAL = PHOENIX   - Adds Element:- Fire
 ELEMENTAL = ALEXANDER - Adds Element:- Holy
 ELEMENTAL = LEVIATHAN - Adds Element:- Water
 ELEMENTAL = TITAN     - Adds Element:- Earth
*ELEMENTAL = RAMUH     - Adds Element:- Lightning
 ELEMENTAL = IFRIT     - Adds Element:- Fire
 ELEMENTAL = SHIVA     - Adds Element:- Ice
*ELEMENTAL = CHOCO/MOG - Adds Element:- Wind

If paired on one's Weapon, then the following Elements will do double damage
when attacking against an enemy that is weak to paired Element.
If paired on one's Armour, then the following Elements will be defended
against.

A level 1 Elemental paired in you Armour will halve the Elemental damage
taken, a level 2 Elemental will nullify the damage and a level 3 Elemental
will absorb the damage. You could equip a level 3 Elemental with Ice to then
use ice to heal yourself!

Many enemies are weak against Lightning, particularly in Midgar. Also, many
enemies are weak against Wind, top. Most enemies in the Great Glacier are Ice-
based, so equipping Fire onto your weapon, or Ice onto your armour is advised.

Pairing Elemental with a Summon is preferable to pairing it with Magic, as
Magic *usually* penalises your physical stats more than a Summon would.

 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 HP / MP ABSORB = LIGHTNING
 ^^^^^^^^^^ ALL = LIGHTNING
            ^^^
With every cast of Lightning, you will hit all enemies whilst also draining
HP/MP. If one of the Lightnings was at level 3, and one of them was at level
2 then only Bolt2 could be used in this way.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 STEAL AS WELL = ICE
 ^^^^^^^^^ ALL = ICE
           ^^^
With every cast of Ice, you will hit all enemies whilst also attempting to
Steal from them.If one of the Ices was at level 3, and one of them was at
level 2 then only Bolt2 could be used in this way.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

       MP TURBO = FIRE
 HP / MP ABSORB = FIRE
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For additional MP, you can cast a more powerful Fire attack to in-turn drain
more HP / MP from the target. If one of the Fires was at level 3, and one of
them was at level 2 then only Bolt2 could be used in this way.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 STEAL AS WELL = COMET2
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Comet will strike with 4 gits hitting random targets, each hit will result in
a steal attempt.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 MAGIC COUNTER = RESTORE
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every time a character is hit, he/she will retaliate by casting Cure on
themselves. This combo will not pair with All or Mega All; the counter Cure
can only be cast on themselves.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 MAGIC COUNTER = COMET2
  QUADRA MAGIC = COMET2
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every time a character is hit, he/she will retaliate by casting Comet2 4
times, unless one of the Comet Materias was only at level 1.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

  ADDED CUT = MASTER COMMAND, DOUBLE CUT
 ^^^^^^^^^^
Every time you use your basic attack, you will follow up with an additional
attack, basically turning it into Double Cut. With Double Cut equipped, you
turn into triple cut, and with 4x Cut equipped you attack for 5 hits.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 STEAL AS WELL = DEATHBLOW
 ^^^ ADDED CUT = DEATHBLOW
     ^^^^^^^^^
Every time you cast Deathblow, you will also attempt to steal from the enemy,
whilst at the same time following up with a basic attack.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 COVER MATERIA + COVER MATERIA + HYPER
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Less of a combo and more of a strategy, this is a great strategy for Limit
Break levelling.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 COUNTER ATTACK X 8, HP PLUS, COVER, LONG RANGE
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every time the character is hit, he/she will retaliate with 8 potential
counter attacks! You could also try pairing Counter with Deathblow.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 MAGIC COUNTER = COMET2, QUADRA MAGIC = COMET2, HP ABSORB = COMET2,
 SNEAK ATTACK  = COMET2,     MP TURBO = COMET2, MP ABSORB = COMET2, W-MAGIC
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
You could, if you wished replace Comet with Ultima, Contain or Gravity for
equally devastating effects. With this combo, you will retaliate to being hit
with 4 castings of Comet2. Note that if you were to replace Sneak Attack with
Added Cut, you would not follow up Magic Counter/Final Attack/Sneak Attack
with Cut; Added Cut only applies to the paired magic when it is selected as a
command. The same applies to HP/MP Absorb, and Steal as Well.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 MP TURBO = KOTR, MP ABSORB = KOTR, W-SUMMON, MIME
 ^^^^^^^^
You can cast KOTR dealing extra damage, and in-turn replenishing more MP with
each casting. Use Mime to continue casting KOTR for 0 MP.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 SNEAK ATTACK = DEATHBLOW, SNEAK ATTACK = DEATHBLOW, MEGA ALL
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the start of every battle the character will have a chance of hitting all
characters with Deathblow. If you are using Yuffie then you can equip her
with the Conformer, and swap out Deathblow for Morph to morph all enemies
into an item each battle.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 QUADRA MAGIC = MASTER MAGIC, MEGA ALL, W-MAGIC
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will be able to use any magic spell 8 times, attacking all targets. Bliss!

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 ADDED CUT = MASTER COMMAND, DOUBLE CUT (4X CUT)
 ^^^^^^^^^
You will be able to use 4x Cut with an added cut on the end, making it 5x Cut!

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 HP ABSORB = MATER COMMAND, SLASH ALL
 ^^^^^^^^^
You will be able to restore HP off of each enemy every time you select Slash
All.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

 ELEMENTAL = ANY MATERIA that ISN'T Support Materia, Restore, or have any
 ^^^^^^^^^               Elemental properties

There is a 'Hidden' Element in the game that has been dubbed the '10th
Element', and every single piece of Materia that doesn't have an Elemental
attribute linked to it will conform to the Hidden Element, unless it is a
Support Materia. Restore has it's own properties.

There are several Status changing attacks in the game that have the Hidden
element, but because no direct damage is taken, it cannot be defended
against. There is only one move in the game that uses Hidden that we can
actually defend against by pairing Elemental with any Materia, and that is
Ultimate WEAPON's 'Ultima Beam'. In the Japanese original, more of the
enemies attacks used Hidden. See section E.05 C for more info.

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 NOTES

 - If you were to pair Steal as Well with Steal, then only one animation will
   play out, although 2 steal attempts will occur.

 - Using Quadra Magic will not quadruple the MP cost.

 - If you were to pair Master Command with either HP Absorb, MP Absorb, Steal
   as Well or Added Cut then the Support Materia's effect would also apply to
   every available command, such as Attack/4x Cut, Sense, even items (so
   watch out).
   This does not apply to Magic, Summon, Limits, Enemy Skills and Throw
   (unless Throw was equipped separately).

 - Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
   occupy the same counter 'limit', which is 8.  If any more than 8 of any of
   the above are equipped to one character, then the surplus combo's would be
   disregarded, in chronological order that they were equipped.

 - You can link duplicates of the same Magic Materia to different Support
   Materia for a 'combined' effect, however not all Support Materia will
   combine with each other:

     SNEAK ATTACK:

      HP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Turbo ------- NO
      Steal as Well -- NO
      Added Cut ------ NO
      All/Mega All --- YES (unless Quadra Magic is also paired)
      Quadra Magic --- YES (disables All/Mega All)
                           (If the enemy dies before the four hits, the Quadra
                            Magic will end)

     FINAL ATTACK:

      HP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Turbo ------- NO
      Steal as Well -- NO
      Added Cut ------ NO
      All/Mega All --- YES (unless Quadra Magic is also paired)
      Quadra Magic --- YES (disables All/Mega All)
                           (If the enemy dies before the four hits, the Quadra
                            Magic will end)

     MAGIC COUNTER:

      HP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Absorb ------ NO
      MP Turbo ------- NO
      Steal as Well -- NO
      Added Cut ------ NO
      All/Mega All --- NO
      Quadra Magic --- YES (If the enemy dies before the four hits, the Quadra
                            Magic will end)

     ALL:

      HP Absorb ------ YES
      MP Absorb ------ YES
      MP Turbo ------- NO
      Steal as Well -- YES
      Added Cut ------ YES
      Quadra Magic --- N/A (disables All/Mega All)

     QUADRA MAGIC:

      HP Absorb ------ YES (with every hit)
      MP Absorb ------ YES (with every hit)
      MP Turbo ------- NO
      Steal as Well -- YES (with every hit)
      Added Cut ------ YES (once only)
      All/Mega All --- NO

   So, you could pair:
   All=Ice - HP Absorb=Ice - MP Absorb=Ice - Steal as Well=Ice - Added Cut=Ice

   So long as all of the Ice Materia is at the same level, each Supporting
   effect will come into play. If all of the Ice were at Level 3, apart from
   the Ice paired with Added Cut which was level 2, then the Added Cut would
   not take effect when Ice3 is cast; only when Ice2 is cast.

  Lucky 7's, or All Lucky 7's has to be one of the coolest easter eggs in the
game, and as such it deserves its own sub-section! Whenever one of your
characters HP lands on precisely 7777, they will enter into the Status 7777
Fever, which will then result in the player attacking random targets for 7777
HP per hit! This frenzy will last for a total of 64 hits, in which time the
enemy will not be able to attack. The total damage will be 497,728, and the
only enemies that can withstand this much damage are Ruby and Emerald WEAPON.

In many ways, All Lucky 7's is similar to a Limit Break; as soon as it is
activated it will take priority over all other commands; the same rainbow
scrolling colours that can normally be seen on the Limit gauge can be seen
over the players name; and the command bar at the top of the screen will turn
purple. When attacking, all Elemental and Status changing properties will be
suspended, and all of the enemies defences will be ignored.

Once the flurry of attacks has finished, the character will not leave 7777
Fever mode until his/her HP has been changed, and any subsequent attacks or
healing spells made will deal 7777 HP. The initial 64-attack rampage cannot
be activated twice during one battle, however a character can go into 7777
Fever more than once, attacking and healing for 7777. If two or more
characters activate All Lucky 7's at the same time, then the result would
still be 64 attacks, only they would be split between the characters as they
take it in turns to mutilate the enemy.

If a battle finishes with a characters HP still at 7777, then the game will
restrict All Lucky 7's re-usage by bringing your HP down to 1. Be very
mindful of this. Also, if an enemy were to enter into 7777 Fever then it may
be wise to flee from battle as you would be in grave danger of being wiped
out; the enemy cannot initiate the 64-attack bombardment, but they will hit
for 7777 each hit. Lastly, should you enter into 7777 Fever whilst Poisoned
then you would instantly kill yourself, as the Poison damage would inflict
7777 HP.

 NOTE - The only battle in the game that disables All Lucky 7's is the final
        battle against Sephiroth.


  HOW TO ACTIVATE ALL LUCKY 7'S

There are 6 methods that I know of to enable 7777 Fever (all credit for the
final 2 methods goes to James Baxter):

1.) Chocobuckle

Every time that you escape from battle, either by using L1 & R1, using the
Exit Materia or by using a Smoke Bomb (Battle Arena doesn't count),
Chocobuckles attack power increases by 1 HP (ignoring defences). If one were
to escape from 2222 battles, then you would be able to bring your HP down
from 9999 to 7777, activating All Lucky 7's. You could also try escaping 1111
times and using it twice, just be sure the enemy doesn't hit you in that time.

2.) Aire Tam Storm

Emerald WEAPON will use an attack called Aire Tam (Materia) Storm that will
deal 1111 HP per Materia that its target has equipped. If you were to equip
just two pieces of Materia, one of them being HP Plus, then your HP would be
brought down to 7777, provided you keep your HP topped up. Emerald will use
Aire Tam Storm in three different circumstances:

 - After opening its eyes, it will use Emerald Beam, Eyes x8, Emerald Beam,
   Eyes x4, Aire Tam Storm. Try to keep one yellow eye alive.
 - After using Revenge Stamp 10 times.
 - As a counter attack to Knights of The Round if its HP is less than 50%
   after the summon has finished. Eyes must be open.

| All of the following methods for activating All Lucky 7's require you to   |
| understand something that's relatively simple to grasp: If the final 2     |
| digits of your current HP were to land on 77 (xx77), and your HP was lower |
| than 7777, then you would be able to bring your current HP to 7777 by      |
| using Potions and Hi-Potions.                                              |

| All references to xx77 will be displayed as '77.                           |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

3.) Mini

Equip one player with Manipulate, and the other two with Enemy Skills with
Goblin Punch on them (unless your characters are not the same level as each
other). Make sure to equip Transform onto one of the two characters with
Enemy Skill. Make sure not to have Mega-All or Slash-All equipped on these
two characters, and make sure their Limits are not full. Speed the Battle
Speed up to the max, and make sure that each players current HP is lower than
7777 (equip HP<->MP then un-equip it).

Enter into a random encounter and then use Manipulate on one enemy whilst
killing the rest. Then, cast Haste if you wish, otherwise inflict Mini on the
two characters that aren't manipulating (you can also use Shrivels). If your
characters are the same level as each other then you can use Goblin Punch for
8 HP worth of damage every hit, otherwise just attack normally for 1 HP until
they reach '77.

4.) Cat's Bell

The Cat's Bell will recover 2 HP per step that you take. You could use this
to make the final 3 digits land on 154, 354, 554, 754 or 954. Then, enter
into battle making sure to either have Demi2 equipped, or the Laser Enemy
Skill. Cast either move, and your HP will be reduced by 50%, landing on '77.

  ALL CREDIT FOR THESE FINAL TWO METHODS GOES TO JAMES BAXTER. Please refer
     to his 7777 FAQ on GameFaq should you wish to view the source of the
                     following data. Used with permission.


5.) Modifying the 'Base' Max HP

Using the HP Data Table below, you will be able to modify your Max HP to
reach '77. Firstly, you must find your 'Base' Max HP (or Base HP). To do that
you must first remove any Materia from a character that would modify their
HP. If your character's Base HP is below 3889 (around Level 50) or above
9970, then you will not be able to modify your HP to reach '77.

Next, equip the relevant Materia modifiers required to reach '77. For
example, if your Base HP was  5254, then your entry would appear as:

 5254 : +29%  -11%  -70% |

To reduce your Base HP by 11%, you would need to equip Magic or Summon
Materia that reduce your HP. The 3 variations of the - modifiers are -2%, -5%
and -10%. So, 3 Materias would be required: 1x -5% and 2x -2% to reach -11%.

To increase your HP by 29%, you would need to use HP Plus Materia, which will
raise your Max HP by 10%, and then 10% thereafter with each level that the HP
Plus gains, for a maximum of 50%. These can stack for a total of 100%. So,
either using a combination of 4 Lv 1 HP Plus's, or one Lv4 HP Plus, you can
bring your Max HP up to 40%, then you can bring your HP down by -5% followed
by 3x -2% to reach +29%.

 Recommended Materia quantity for each modifier:
   2x  HP Plus Mastered OR 10x HP Plus Lv 1
   6x -10% modifiers
   7x -5%  modifiers
   8x -2%  modifiers

Once you have obtained an xx77 figure for your Max HP, you must then bring
your current HP to Max HP if it isn't already (X-Potion, etc.) Then, making
sure that no adjustments are made to any Materia that could reduce your Max
HP, remove the -% modifiers until your Max HP is above 7777. As mentioned,
you can then use Hi-Potions and Potions to bring your HP up to 7777 (or 7767
if you wished to activate Lucky 7's mid-battle).

Of all 6111 possible Base HP values above (and including) 3889, 75% (4548)
can be modified to reach '77. If you find that your Base HP value isn't
listed, then refer to method 6:

6.) Modifying the 'Base' Max MP, then using HP<->MP

Quite simply, refer to the MP Data Table to find the required modifier to
manipulate your Base MP as so that you can reach x77. Then equip and un-equip
the HP<->MP Materia to bring your HP down to your MP, provided that your
current HP was higher than your Max MP to begin with.

You cannot do this if your Base MP is higher than 977, as there are no
modifiers that decrease MP. The only + modifiers are +2%, +5%, and +10%. MP
Plus will increase your Max MP by multiples of 10%, up to 50% as per the
level of the Materia. Effects can stack up to 100%.

You also cannot do this if your Base HP is lower than 3889, as the most you
can increase your HP by is 100% (7777 / 2 = 3888.5). Because of this, there
will be no listings for Base MP lower than 300, as you cannot have more than
300 Base MP with less than 3889 Base HP. Of all 678 possible Base MP values
between 300 and 977, 310 (46%) can be modified to reach '77.

  Perhaps the oldest trick in the book, the W-Item glitch will allow you to
duplicate any item, so long as it is usable in-battle, and so long as you
have the W-Item Materia, which is obtained from the raid on Midgar towards
the end of Disk 2. Here's how it works:

It is recommended that you have the ATB set to 'Wait' whilst performing the W-
Item trick. Whilst in-battle, have the character with W-Item equipped select
the item that you wish to duplicate (say, a Megalixir). Then, select any item
as your second item, but instead of confirming a target for that item, cancel
the second item and you will have noticed that the initial item will have
increased by one.

You can now press O, X, O, X etc. (or confirm, cancel, confirm, cancel) until
you have 99 of the desired item. This is useful for things like Sylkis
Greens, as not only do they sell for a lot of money but they will also help
you with the Chocobo breeding process. Elixirs are useful too, as they can be
fed to the Magic Pots for high amounts of AP and EXP.

Be warned - If you only have one item left then you could end up accidentally
losing that item if you cancel out the W-Item command before selecting the
second item.

  This is slightly more tricky method than the normal W-Item trick, and it
allows you to duplicate items that aren't usable in battle, such as Sources
and Weapons. There are a few variation to the way the trick works.


--- STEALING/MORPHING ITEMS FROM MULTIPLE ENEMIES ---

First make sure that you have *one* expendable item at the top of the
inventory list (such as a Potion), then make sure that you have 0 of the item
you wish to duplicate. For my example, I'm going to be duplicating Power
Sources from the Screamers in Mt. Nibel. Note that using Yuffie's Conformer
is the best way to Morph an enemy.

 NOTE - This trick works best when faced with multiple enemies. You can still
        dupe items from single enemies, however it's a lot trickier and takes
        much longer to set-up.

Set Yuffie up with Morph, Cloud with Manipulate and player 3 with W-Item. You
can only battle the Screamer on the winding path leading towards the reactor,
or at the reactor itself (you'll have a higher chance of encountering them at
the reactor). When you encounter them, kill off all but the two Screamers,
then Manipulate one of them.

Now have Yuffie cast Morph. Before the move is executed, have player 3 use W-
Item, and use the single Potion as your first item. Now wait for the Screamer
to be Morphed into a Power Source. If done correctly, the Power Source will
fill the same inventory slot that was occupied by the Potion. You can now
select and cancel another item, thereby duplicating the Power Sources up to
99.

For Magic Sources you can encounter 2x 8 Eye in the Battle Arena in round 3.
For this battle you must set Yuffie up with Counter=Morph. It is imperative
that you cast Stop, Sleep or Paralyzed on one of the 8 Eyes. When the other
attacks, select the single Potion then wait for Yuffie to counter with Morph.
So long as the other 8 Eye cannot attack, you will be able to dupe yourself
99 Magic Sources.

Luck Sources and Speed Sources can be duped from Bad Raps and Poodlers,
respectively (Sunken Gelnika), and Guard Sources can be duped from the Spiral
near Mideel. Mind Sources are the hardest to farm seeing as they can only be
obtained from the Serpent (once you've obtained the W-Item Materia), and they
only ever come in single formations.


--- STEALING/MORPHING ITEMS FROM SINGLE ENEMIES ---

First make sure that you have *one* expendable item at the top of the
inventory list (such as a Potion), then make sure that you have 0 of the item
you wish to duplicate. For this example I am going to be morphing Mind
Sources from the Serpent on the Sunken Gelnika. Set Cloud up with Final
Attack=Revive and Quadra Magic=Revive. Set Yuffie up with Final Attack=Morph,
and lastly set player 3 up with W-Item. *MAKE SURE* that Yuffie is player 1
(at the top) so that she uses Morph before Cloud uses Life2.

Enter into battle with the Serpent. Make sure that Cloud's and Yuffie's HP
are in critical, then start bringing the Serpent's HP down using L4 Suicide;
It is more likely to cast Aqualung that way. The idea is to have Cloud and
Yuffie KO'd at the same time. Yuffie will then retaliate by Morphing the
Serpent into a Mind Source, and Cloud will cast Life2 four times.

Prior to Yuffie using Morph, make sure that player 3 is sitting in the W-Item
screen with the Potion 'used', awaiting input of the second item. If done
correctly, the Potion's inventory slot will be filled with the Mind Source,
you will then have time to dupe yourself 99 of them while Cloud casts Life2.

The Serpent's attacks are dependent on your party's average current HP and
the Serpents Current HP. If the Serpent's HP is:
 -  0% -  20% of party's current HP, Dragon Dance is used.
 - 21% -  40% of party's current HP, Huge Tidal Wave is used.
 - 41% -  80% of party's current HP, Aqualung is used.
 - 81% - 100% of party's current HP, Viper Breath is used.
Using L4 Suicide and Cure, you should be able to regulate the Serpent's HP
until it uses Aqualung.

 NOTE - If you happen to be playing on a Playstation console, then you can
        simply open the lid, thereby not allowing the battle to finish. This
        way you can dupe the Source without having to go through the Final
        Attack method.


--- HAVING ITEMS STOLEN FROM YOU ---

This works similarly to the previous two methods, only this way could take
much, much longer seeing as an element of luck is involved. The plus side is
that you will be able to duplicate *almost* any piece of armour, accessory or
weapon using this method.

Similar to the previous methods, you must have *one* expendable item at the
top of your inventory list (such as a Potion), and only one of the item that
you wish to duplicate in your inventory. For this example I am going to be
duplicating myself 99 Mystiles. First I'll make sure to have equipped all but
one Mystile, then I'll get into battle with an enemy that can steal from me.
These locations include:

 - Vice, Sector 5
 - Prowler, Midgar Area (World Map)
 - Magic Pot, Swamp Area North Crater.

The Bandit can also steal from you, however you cannot reenter Corel Prison.

I shall be battling the Vice in Sector 5. Be sure to encounter them in their
2x formation, they'll only be found in the first 2 screens from the church.
Manipulate one and wait for the other to steal from you, if you are lucky
then it will steal the item that you wish to dupe. Now kill it to have your
item returned to you, but not before having the player with W-Item select the
Potion. When the item is returned to you you'll be able to duplicate yourself
99 of the item. You'll be able to stock up on Potions easily in Sector 5,
aswell as save your game.

If you had more than one of the desired item in your inventory, then you
would not be able to duplicate it seeing as it would return to the inventory
slot it came from, as opposed to filling up the inventory slot that was
occupied by the Potion. The following items *cannot* be duplicated this way:

 - ALL Limit Break Manuals
 - Battery
 - Save Crystal
 - Combat Diary
 - Autograph
 - Gambler
 - Desert Rose
 - Earth Harp
 - Buster Sword
 - Gatling Gun
 - Seraph Comb
 - Silver Barrette

Basically, if a weapon/item can be sold at a shop, then it can be stolen from
you. Technically speaking Sephiroth's Masamune should also be on the above
list, as it cannot be sold a any shop, although there is no way to obtain the
Masamune on your inventory without the use of hacks.


--- THROWING WEAPONS ---

Using the same methods as above, you can have one character kill another mid-
battle. Before the character is killed, have him/her use the Throw command to
throw one of your valuable weapons, then quickly have the W-Item holder use
up the single Potion. When the character is K.O'd, the weapon will be
returned to the first empty available slot, unless you had more than one to
begin with. The best way to kill off a character is to have another character
use W-Magic and Contain.


--- STEALING 198 ITEMS ---

It is possible to fill two inventory slot with the same item, thereby being
able to hold up to 198 of that particular item. The main condition is that
the item is steal-able or morph-able. For this example I'm going to be
stealing an Elixir from the Gighee in the Swamp Area in the North Crater.

Equip one player with Steal and another with W-Item. Make sure to have the
top item slot filled with a single Potion, and the second from the top being
the Elixir. It is important that the Potion is above the Elixir, and that you
also only have one Elixir in stock.

During battle, use up the Potion, then have your character Steal the Elixir
from the Gighee. Before the item is added to your stock, have the W-Item
holder use up the single Elixir that is in your inventory. When the Elixir is
stolen, the top inventory slot will be filled with the new Elixir. You can
the dupe yourself 99 Elixirs in the second slot, then use the normal W-Item
trick to dupe another 99 Elixirs in the top slot.

                                                                 {Easter Eggs}

  What is an Easter Egg? The definition seems to have changed slightly. A
long time ago, and Easter Egg would have been a small hidden feature within a
game *that does not affect gameplay whatsoever*. Remember playing Legend of
Zelda Ocarina of Time? When you sneak into Zelda's castle you can see
pictures of Mario and friends in the windows. A classic Easter Egg.

Now it appears as though an Easter Egg can have an impact on your gameplay
(usually for the better) and still be regarded as an Easter Egg. Cod Zombies
is a perfect example. Most of the following Easter Eggs do not affect
gameplay, although one or two of them do. Technically speaking, an Easter Egg
is always an intentional addition, unlike a glitch which is not intentional!

Lucky 7's falls into the category of an Easter Egg.


                                                            {Secret Cow Level}

If you happen to be playing the Steam or PS4 versions of Final Fantasy VII,
then you will be able to use your Save Crystal to activate an Easter egg.
After you get to the main fork, send Cloud left to get to the second fork. If
you were to use your Save Crystal in this screen (the one with the upper and
lower fork) then the in-game area would name would change from "Inside
Northern Cave" to "Secret Cow Level", which is a reference to Diablo.

This Easter Egg is only activated once, and when you leave and re-enter the
screen the area name will revert back to it's default display. This won't
work on any version other than the PS4 and Steam versions.

It is unclear whether or not this little trick has been intentionally
included, or is a 'bug' of the escape feature. Throughout the game you will
come across enemies that have surprise attacked you, or 'back attack' as it
is referred to in-game. When this happens you will receive double damage from
the first physical attack you receive. By tapping L1 and R1, you can turn to
face the enemy, thereby negating the double damage taken.

Note that when you receive a back attack, your rows will be reversed. If this
bothers you, press left on the D-Pad to change back to their original rows.
If you decide not to, then when the battle finishes your rows will be back to
normal.

If a character has the Sprint Shoes equipped then they will never have their
back to the enemies when the battle begins.

  UPDATE - The above is NOT true. Many people believe that by tapping L1+R1
           they can negate the effects of receiving double damage, BUT, due
           to a bug the enemy will not hit you for double damage, and you'll
           receive the same amount of damage regardless of which direction
           you're facing. The only hindrance of a Back Attack is having your
           rows reversed, and starting with an empty ATB gauge.

           There are still attacks that can hit you from behind causing
           double damage, namely when you have been attacked form both sides.

When using Tifa's Limit Breaks, Cait Sith's Slots Limit Break, or selecting a
handicap in the battle Arena, you can slow down the rate at which the reel
spins by tapping Square. This is most effective in the Battle Arena; pressing
confirm on the handicap that is *2* prior to the desired handicap is the
easiest way to manipulate the reels.

section E.02 E, or use QSI Link [Slots].

There is one weapon in the game that ignores the damage penalty when using
the command Morph. Usually, Morph will attack for 1/8 of normal damage, but
Yuffie's Conformer has a damage modifier that overrules the damage penalty
when using Morph. And where can this morphing weapon be found? In the same
place where the enemies can be morphed into Sources - the Sunken Gelnika!

  HALLWAY:

 Poodler - 6000 HP - 70 AP - Morph: Speed Source - Steal: Turbo Ether
 Bad Rap - 9000 HP - 70 AP - Morph: Luck Source  - Steal: Ink

  CARGO ROOM/RESEARCH ROOM: (The Serpent can only be fought in the Cargo
Room.)

 Unknown   - 10,000 HP - 150 AP - Morph: Power Source - Steal: Fire Armlet
 Unknown 2 - 13,000 HP - 300 AP - Morph: Guard Source - Steal: Aurora Armlet
 Unknown 3 - 15,000 HP - 200 AP - Morph: Magic Source - Steal: Bolt Armlet
 Serpent   - 14,000 HP -  70 AP - Morph: Mind  Source - Steal: Water Ring

I suspect that the morphing abilities of the Conformer were unintentional,
but given the fact that the developers were unable to fix it, they decided to
work it into the mechanics of the games 'reward system', which is why the
Conformer is found in the same place where Sources can be morphed. Just a
speculation.

When Source farming, it is important to know what weapons to equip, as a lot
of weapons will boost your character's raw stats. Here are the optimal
weapons to equip:

Cloud     - Nail Bat
Barret    - Gatling Gun, Drill Arm, Rocket Punch or Pile Banger.
Tifa      - Leather Glove, Work Glove, or Master Fist.
Aeris     - Guard Stick or Mythril Rod.
Red XIII  - Magic Comb
Yuffie    - 4-Point Shuriken
Cait Sith - Battle Trumpet
Vincent   - Silver Rifle
Cid       - Mop

It is also worth noting that the easiest way in which to amass large
quantities of Sources in a short amount of time is to utilise the Extended W-

Have you ever wondered what was behind barking dog when you first travelled
through Junon's underground pathways on your way to the Reactor? Have you
also ever wondered what would've happened if you had failed the underwater
mini game in which you had to sink the Red Sub? Well, aside from losing the
Huge Materia, you would also lose the Grey Submarine, which means you
wouldn't be able to access the Sunken Gelnika, fight Emerald WEAPON, or
obtain the key to the Ancients.

Wait a minute, wouldn't that prevent you from finishing the game? Well,
technically no, seeing as you would be able to obtain the Red Submarine by re-
visiting Junon's underground pathways. This time you'll have to defeat two
weak Shinra Guards that are standing by the dog, once they're out of the way
you can interact with the dog to open up the passageway. As with the grey
sub, you'll have the option to take the crew on board as hostage.

The red Submarine looks cool, and in my opinion it should've been the main
sub, and the Grey Sub should've been the secondary sub. Oh well. In the Red
Sub you'll be able to do everything that you could've with the Grey Sub,
aside from getting the Huge Materia.

A recurring easter egg of the Final Fantasy series, the Moai Face can usually
be seen in extremely remote locations on the World Map. in FFIV the Moai Face
can be seen on the moon, in FFV it can be seen on the seabed, and in FFVIII
it can be seen during a battle on the World Map during PuPu's sidequest.

FFVII is the first Final Fantasy to put the Moai Face in a location that
isn't on a World Map, and it can be seen in 2 different locations. The first
place that it can be spotted at is in the Chocobo Races during the long
track, and the second Moai Face can be found camouflaged into the rock face
on the north-western most screen in the Great Glacier.

After you have completed the Mideel events on Disk 2, you be able to dig for
the Key to Sector 5 in Bone Village. Once you have obtained this key item,
you will be able to return to Midgar, namely Sectors 5 & 6. Should you return
to the church where you first met Aeris, you'll find Aeris praying on the
flower beds, at least for a short while anyway. When you approach her, she'll
flicker and vanish. Should you speak to the girl there, she will ask "Hey!
Where's the flower lady??"

It has been speculated that this was some sort of glitch, and that this scene
wasn't supposed to occur. That is false; Aeris's Ghost is programmed to
occur, although there is a slight glitch involving a glimpse of Aeris for
just a few frames as you enter and the screen fades from black. Aeris won't
be in her usual spot neither, she will be in the dead centre of the screen,
just south of the flower bed. This is a glitch, and isn't supposed to have
been seen.

Have you ever wondered about the empty chest in the well in Corel? Well, even
though the chest itself remains to be a mystery, there is something hidden
within the background layer of this screen, and that is an odd-looking red
man (referred to in the scripting as "doll"):

http://www.ff7citadel.com/secrets/sp_redman.shtml

While there is absolutely nothing to this red guy other than his existence
(as in, he does nothing at all), it is very interesting to note that this
screen served as a test screen for the programmers, and they accidentally
forgot to remove the test enemies in the original Japanese release. Normally,
you'll fight 4x 2-Faced down here, but in the Jap version you would encounter
the "Test 0" subjects, all of which had incredibly high HP, but also dropped
a large amount of EXP/AP/gil. Funnily enough, the skeleton that you see in
this screen is that of one of the test subjects. Here is a video from

If you bring Aeris and/or Tifa along with you during your first visit to
Gongaga, then you'll have some additional dialogue with them that can raise
or lower their affinity towards you, depending on the choices you make and
the dialogue options you choose.

What isn't widely known is the fact you will get slightly different dialogue
if either Aeris and/or Tifa's affection value is higher than 120:

It is impossible to reveal Aeris's bonus dialogue without using some sort of
cheat device, however you can raise Tifa's affection to above 120 by making
use of the exploit as listed below.

Additionally, if Tifa's affection rating is above 50 after the Midgar Events
on Disk 2, then a very slightly different scene will play out during the time
Cloud and Tifa spend together.

What isn't very well known about is the dummied out content that was supposed
to have taken place just outside of Gongaga village, on the same screen as
the Deathblow Materia. This would have occurred after Cloud had remarked "A
ruined reactor", had Barret in your party, and you had spoken to at least one
NPC within Gongaga.

When you get to The Icicle Inn on Disk 2, there will be a few videos for you
to watch in the western house. This house belonged to Professor Gast, and the
videos that are contained here will help you understand the story plot as a
whole. These videos can be accessed at any point in the game thereafter.

It's not worth creating a new sub-section for this, but it is worth pointing
out that there is another optional video for you to watch in the Shinra
Mansion. Revisit the underground laboratory once you have completed the
Lifestream events on Disk 2, and you will learn a little bit more about
Cloud's past, and why he is the way he is.

  Given the high volume of glitches found within FFVII, I have decided to
split the glitches segment into 2 - exploitable glitches and non-exploitable
glitches. By definition, a glitch is something that has been included within
the game *un-intentionally*. Some of these glitches can be used to our
advantage, and some of these glitches hinder us. The following are glitches
that we can exploit to our benefit.

The W-Item glitch falls into the category of an exploit.


                                                             {Underflowing HP}

 \   ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '  /

This glitch will only work for the PS4. If you equip enough Materia, you can
send you HP past -100% to underflow it over to 65535, capped at 9999. So you
would basically need 10 x Materias that drained your Max HP by 10%, and then
an 11th Materia to send it past 100%. Here is a list of Materia that does
exactly that:

 - Contain
 - Full Cure
 - Shield
 - Ultima
 - Phoenix
 - Neo Bahamut
 - Hades
 - Typoon
 - Bahamut Zero
 - Knights of Round

Jay_d_d (who found the glitch) worked out that the earliest you could make
use of this exploit would be just before Carry Armor; Ultima, Contain, Full
Cure, Neo Bahamut and Phoenix, along with 10x -5% materias, then any other -
2% materia to go past the -100% mark.

There are four characters in the game that have affection values, of which 3
can be exploited - Barret's, Tifa's and Yuffie's. Aeris's cannot be exploited.

TIFA:

During your raid on the Shinra HQ during Disk 1, you'll be able to talk to
Tifa multiple times to keep boosting her affection values indefinitely (max
255). Every time you choose option 1, "Leave it to me" to boost her affection
by 1. Choosing "Kinda hard" will lower her affection by 1, and can be
repeated to bring her value down to 0.

BARRET:

When you first arrive at Cosmo Canyon, male sure to have Barret in your
party. Enter the back of Tiger Lily's weapon shop, and talk to Barret. Choose
option 1 to boost his affection by three, then choose option 2. Run out of
the screen, and repeat the process to continually boost his rating by 3. When
you do choose option 1 on the second choice, you'll increase Barret's
affection by another three, and the glitch will no longer be exploitable.

Do not spam this too heavily if you are trying to obtain the Best Bromance
Trophy, as doing so will prevent the trophy from popping.

YUFFIE:

When you recruit Yuffie, you will have 5 dialogue choices, each correct
answer boosting her affection towards you by two. When you correctly answer
the fifth choice, she will have joined your party and you won't be able to
make use of the exploit. Instead, purposely fail the fifth choice, then
battle her again to repeat the process. You cannot raise her affection more
than 30 by doing this, which means that you can only repeat this twice before
recruiting her as normal.

See section E.07 for more info on the recruiting process.


                                                            {Infinite Elixirs}

Normally, when you pick up an item the main playable character is frozen, and
the menu is disabled. Then you'll hear the sound effect, followed by the item
being added into your inventory. Then a flag is enabled which signifies the
item has been picked up, and then the text box appears. When you close the
text box, the item disappears and you regain full control.

In the case of the Elixir and the Potion in the Great Glacier, this is not
the case. The first thing that takes place is the item is added to your
inventory, as opposed to disabling control of the character and menu. Then
you hear the sound, then you receive the text box, but because you can still
move your character, you can simply leave and re-enter the screen to repeat
this process as many times as you like. So long as you don't press confirm to
close the dialogue box, the Elixir/Potion will not be removed from the field.

The Mind Source has a similar bug, where movement will not be disabled when
you pick it up, although the item isn't programmed to add itself to your
inventory until after you close the dialogue box, so if you were to exit and
re-enter the screen again the item would still be there, but your Mind Source
count will still be the same.


                                                          {Repeat Boss Glitch}

Confirmed to work on all version of Final Fantasy VII (including the PS4
version), you can if you wished to fight any boss in the game twice
consecutively, with the exception of Emerald, Ruby, Diamond and Ultimate
WEAPON (basically, only Bosses that can be fought on a *field* map can be
fought twice). This is particularly useful for grabbing battle spoils more
than once, especially for obtaining duplicates of valuable items.

How is this trick performed?

Firstly, you must save your game then reset. Then enter into a field screen
that contains enemies and you will eventually will engage in a 'random'
encounter. Exit the battle and take not of your position on the field screen.
Now reset the game. If you now follow the precise route that you took
previously, you will notice that you will engage in the encounter in the
*exact* location you did previously (technically speaking, you've travelled
the exact amount of steps as you did previously).

You must press triangle to open the menu at the *exact* moment the battle is
supposed to begin. If performed correctly, you will skip out the battle
completely. If you engage in another random encounter before fighting a boss,
then you'll have to start over, but if you manage to make it so that the next
encounter is a 'forced' encounter, it will happen twice! Occasionally the
music will play incorrectly, and occasionally the game will freeze up!

There are only two items that you can obtain this way that *cannot* be duped
using the (Extended) W-Item Trick, and these are:

Cosmo Memory - Obtained from Lost number, fought in the Shinra Mansion.
               Only one extra copy can be obtained this way.

All Creation - Obtained from Godo, fought in the top floor of the Pagoda in
               Wutai. Due to the fact that you will not be met with a Game-
               Over screen should you lose the second battle, you can repeat
               this glitch as many times as you please. If you are trying to
               obtain 99 of All Creations, then remember to teach Yuffie the
               Limit Break in the process, otherwise you will be stuck with
               98 copies if you teach it to her afterwards!

               Once you have performed the repeat-boss glitch on Godo, you'll
               need to head back over to the Da-chao to 'skip' another random
               encounter, should you wish to rinse-and-repeat this glitch.

There are a few times in the game that you will be able to skip a portion of
the game out by simply holding down a specific direction on the D-Pad.

 MIDGAR SKIP:

Towards the end of Disk 2, you will be required to fly over Midgar to trigger
the point-of-no return for that Disk. Just prior to this however (after
defeating Diamond WEAPON), you are required to fly over the North Crater to
trigger a scene within the Shinra HQ involving Reeve, Scarlet and Heidegger.
If you were to keep the "Down" and "Right" buttons compressed while this
scene plays out, then you would find yourself at the top of the Mako Cannon,
just before the Hojo battle. This works on all versions.

This glitch is only recommended for speed runners, as you would permanently
be missing out on the weapons Missing Score, Max Ray, Ragnarok, HP Shout,
Master Fist and Behemoth Horn amongst other great items.

 JUNON FMV SKIP:

This glitch will only shave off about 70 seconds of gameplay, but for speed
runners that's probably enough to want to know about it. On Disk 2, when
Sapphire WEAPON attacks, the Mako Cannon will fire it's first shot into the
distance. Just afterwards, whilst everyone is waiting anxiously to see the
results, you'll have a short opportunity to hold "Down & Left" whilst
running. If done correctly, you'll skip out the whole part where we see
Sapphire for the first time, and instead you'll take control of Barret. Head
down to the conference room to continue on with the story.

PC ORIGINAL / STEAM VERSION ONLY! (*doesn't* work on the PS4)

Yuffie Warping is a glitch that basically enables you to warp from one save
file to another. So you could if you wished take a level 99 party back to
fight the Guard Scorpion, or you could bring a party containing (spoiler) to
Disk 2. There are restrictions to how early in the game this can be
performed, and there are a number of glitches that will occur depending on
when you're warping from/to.

Here's how it works:

1) You must first choose the save game that you wish to warp *from*. You must
   not have recruited Yuffie, and it helps if you have reached the small
   forests near Rocket Town. Make sure that you have saved in the actual
   forests.

   This glitch will only work if you encounter Yuffie without having
   travelled onto a field map screen after loading. It doesn't matter how
   many times you have to fight to encounter her, just don't travel onto a
   field map.

2) Now you must load up the save file that you wish to warp *to*. What you
   must now do is engage in a battle. It doesn't matter whether it is a
   scripted battle or a random encounter, all that matters is that you
   encounter the enemy on a field map and not on the world map (Diamond
   WEAPON is the exception to this).

3) Purposely lose that battle to receive a game over screen. Now load the
   first save file, the file that you wish to jump *from*. Engage in a random
   battle in the forests. If this first battle is not Yuffie then you will
   have to repeat step 2. Defeat Yuffie.

4) After the battle has finished, instead of being taken to the screen in
   which you recruit Yuffie (with the Save point), you will be transported to
   the *other* save file; the battle in which you had died! Technically
   speaking it's only warping you to that particular location; it's still the
   same save file.

   If the game over screen occurred on a scripted battle, then the scripted
   battle would be repeated. If the game over screen occurred on a random
   encounter, then you would warp back to that field map, although no battle
   would occur.

And that's how to Yuffie warp!


There are an enormous amount of bugs that could occur as a result of using
this glitch, as technically speaking you're *not* actually warping to that
part of the game; all of the "progression" flags would still be set to where
they were in the initial save file (the one you warped from). For example,
let's suppose you were going to warp from a save file where you are just
about to defeat Diamond WEAPON, right back to the Materia Keeper fight. After
you had defeated the Materia Keeper you would find that you were still at
exactly the same point in the game where you warped from; at the Diamond
WEAPON fight. This is because no flags are set or unset after the Materia
Keeper fight, other then that of the Materia Keeper itself.

If however you were to warp to the Guard Scorpion, then the game would (at
some point) change the "Game Moment" value. Every major event that occurs
will advance the "Game Moment" value by a set amount, and at various points
in the game a check is performed to see what scene should be playing out
based on the Game Moment value. The problem is, there are also a number of
"progression flags" that are ticked and un-ticked independently of the Game
Moment value, and there are times where the game calls for Game Moment, and
there are times when it calls for Progression flags.

After the Guard Scorpion Fight, the Game Moment is still set at the value it
was prior to warping, and all of the progression flags are still up. So, when
you reach the elevator, the game thinks that you are further than you
actually are, and sends you to the second reactor (the same elevator is used
in both reactors). You will then be able to progress to fight Air Buster, as
that fight is always scripted to happen when you reach that screen. After the
fight has finished, the Game Moment value is then assigned to that part of
the game, so the game plays out as it would normally, until you get to Wall
Market. The game then calls for the progression flags at this stage, and all
of them will already be "set", so you will not be able to trigger the events
at Don's Mansion to occur, nor will you be able to make the shiny rope appear.

There are a few other bugs that occur. For example, very often when warping
the music will not play properly; it'll play the soundtrack after the one
you're supposed to be hearing. Also, if you've warped from one disk to
another, then the FMV will play a different vid to the one it's supposed to.
If a character is forced into or out of your party at certain stages then the
game could get confused as to who you had as your 3rd member. Lastly, the
vehicle flags will not revert back; if you warped from Disk 2 to Disk 1, then
you would not be able to drive the buggy or the Tiny Bronco.

If you had missed out on Pandora's Box due the Dragon Zombie's skill power
being used up, then there is a way to reset the "Pandora's Box" flag. For
some reason, after Jenova Synthesis has been killed the Pandora's Box flag is
then reset, meaning the Dragon Zombie will use PB once more. After you have
warped to the Jenova battle, you will kill Bizarro and Safer as normal (but
with some weird FMVs playing), then the game will take you to the bottom of
the North Crater screen. Because Game Moment will be lower than it normally
should be, the game thinks that you have entered that screen for the first
time, and you will be allowed to roam as you please, effectively prior to the
point of no return (so you can go off and learn Pandora's box).

This doesn't come without a price however, as you would have to refrained
from recruiting Yuffie until Disk 3, which means that you won't be able to
obtain the MP Absorb materia.

Benefits of using this exploit:

 - Being able to obtain 99 Cosmo Memories (perfect save file).
 - Being able to obtain 99 Seraph Combs (perfect save file).
 - Permanently missable items can be re-obtained.
 - Being able to un-check the Pandora's Box flag.
 - Can enter the debug room legitimately (read below).
 - Can repeat the Diamond Boss battle as many times as you please for great
   battle spoils.

 HOW TO WARP TO THE DEBUG ROOM *WITHOUT* HACKS

What is the debug room? Read the following section to learn all about it;
it's basically a 'testing' ground for the developers, and is home to a lot of
cool features. Until recently, it was believed that the only way to access
the debug rooms (there are more than one) was through hacks. Through
elaborate use of the Yuffie Warping glitch however, it is possible to access
the debug rooms legitimately. Here's how:

1) SET UP A 'GLITCHED' FILE

Before doing anything, you'll need to have 2 save file. One in which you have
obtained the Highwind, and another in the Shinra HQ, before fighting Motor
Ball.

1 - Load up the save file with the Highwind. Fly over to Midgar, and
    *remember where you park it*. Now travel by foot over to Junon Forests.
    Save your game here into a new slot.

2 - Now load up your other save file, and get into the Motor Ball fight.
    Purposely loose this battle, so that you get a game over screen.

3 - Load up the first save file, and keep battling until you encounter the
    Mystery Ninja. Defeat her to Yuffie warp to the Motor Ball fight. Defeat
    Motor Ball and escape Midgar.

4 - Now head over to the *invisible* Highwind (remember where you parked it)
    and then fly over to the back entrance to Mt Nibel. Before entering, be
    sure to have Barret and Red XIII in your party (and NOT Cait Sith,
    Vincent, Tifa or Cid).

5 - When you enter the back entrance of Mt. Nibel, the game will appear to
    have frozen. Wait roughly 10 seconds to find out that it hasn't. Once you
    have regained control of Cloud, leave Mt. Nibel back to the World Map and
    save your game into a new slot.

You now have a 'glitched' save file, in which the game will not be taken to
the reward screen at the end of a battle. Some really peculiar things occur
when these parameters have been set up. For example, we can now trick the
game into confusing the *battle ID* for the *field ID*....

2) ENTER INTO THE DEBUG ROOM

To make things quicker, you could kill off all three party members of this
'glitched' file. Do that by first killing Red and Barret in a battle, escape
from said battle, then swap out Red or Barret for someone (alive). Enter into
another battle, kill Cloud, escape, then swap the alive character for the
dead one. Save over this file.

1 - Enter into Mt. Nibel through the back entrance. Enter into a battle on
    the first screen and die.

2 - Now load up the save file that you wish to warp to the debug room from.
    This has to be at any point during the game *after* having obtained the
    Tiny Bronco.

3 - Fly over to the World Map area just outside of Mt. Nibel (Rocket Town
    side), and enter into a battle just outside the entrance. Defeat the
    enemy to warp to the field map that you had died on. Note that you could
    have won any battle on the world map and you would've warped to this
    location, however you'll need a means of transport parked outside of Mt.
    Nibel.

    *DO NOT* enter into a field map from this point on.

4 - Now fly over to Junon. What you want to do now is enter into a battle
    with 2x Nerosuferoth (front row), and 1x Formula (back row). Keep fleeing
    from battles until you encounter this battle (DON'T defeat any enemies).
    This is battle formation # 65.

5 - Once you have fled from battle formation # 65 (2x Nerosuferoth and 1x
    Formula), the game weirdly assigns the battle formation ID as the field
    map ID to jump to on the next battle you win. So, defeat the next
    encounter and you will jump you to field map # 65, which is the entrance
    to the debug room.

    Enjoy!

Battle formation 65 isn't the only ID we can utilise. In fact, as long as the
battle formation is on the World Map, you can warp to any field map that
shares the same ID as the battle formation that you last escaped from, and
there are 264 World Map battles that can be exploited this way, which is the
equivalent of Hojo's lab in terms of progression (Hojo's lab is the 264th
map).

Another World Map battle ID you could use to send you into the debug room is
battle # 96 - 3x Spencers and 1x Flapbeat (Gold Saucer Area). Field Map # 96
is Debug Room 5.


                                                                  {Debug Room}

For information on how to enter the debug room without using hacks, refer to
the above section regarding Yuffie Warping. Otherwise, you'll need to use a
program such as Black Chocobo or Makou Reactor to enter the debug room.

Alternatively, the following game shark codes will warp you to the debug room:

80099F2C 0041 - EU  version
8009ABF6 0041 - US  version
800987F4 0041 - JAP version
8009A174 0041 - French version

Enter these codes in first, then either load a save game or start a fresh
game. Make sure that you are not loading onto a world map, in fact, just stay
away from the world map altogether. Now, enter into another field map and you
should warp to the debug room, just remember to turn off the cheat device
afterwards other wise you'll keep warping to the debug room every time you
enter into a new field screen.

If the problem persists after turning off the gameshark, then try talking to
Yuffie in the default room, and selecting option 2 - "MENU ON". You can now
save your game. Do so, then reset to be able to explore the debug rooms
without warping to the default room every time.

There is an awful lot of content contained within the debug rooms, and I
don't intend to go into detail here, as it would make this section far too
long. When the time comes for me to write the "Helpful Stuff" section (G.10),
I will then cite every use thing there is to do within the debug rooms. For
now, you should visit:

                                                             {Regen Glitch}

 \   ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '  /

This is perhaps the easiest exploit to perform, the downside being that it
can only work on a PS1 console. During a battle, cast Regen on all party
members. Then, simply open the lid of the console. The game will continue
playing, however no command will be executed until the lid is closed again.
Meaning, you can just sit and watch as your HP completely replenishes, whilst
the enemy just sits there, doing nothing.

This glitch can also be exploited to prolong the end of a battle when using
the Extended W-Item trick, specifically against the Serpent. Use QSI Link
[Extended W-Item Trick] for more details (or just scroll up).

This exploit is very well known about. Once you obtain the Highwind, it is
possible for you to grab the Quadra Magic Materia from the Materia Cave near
Mideel, prior to breeding a coloured Chocobo. It may take a few tries, but
here's what you have to do:

First off, fly over to the Materia Cave near Mideel. You'll find it at the
very end of the peninsula. Now make your way south-west until you get to the
nearest bit of green land. Have the Highwind face directly south, and line it
up with the very edge of the overhang. You must now elevate the Highwind as
high as possible, then press X. As you are descending, press left and Square
at the same time. If you've executed it correctly, then the Highwind will
have landed on the Green verge with Cloud on the dirt area below.

As mentioned, it could take a bit of practise. Don't get excited either the
very moment you land on the rocky area - very often you will get stuck, and
will have to get back on board the Highwind to become unstuck.


                                                     {Master Command Glitches}

 \   ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '  /

This is a really cool glitch, that is definitely worth considering trying
out, although it does come with a few drawbacks.

Have you ever tried to pair Added Cut with Double Cut (4x cut) to try to
attack 5 times? Well, it wouldn't work. Unless, you were to pair Added Cut
with Master Command, and equipped Double Cut separately. In fact, you would
now also hit with an additional attack every time you used "Attack", "Slash-
All", "Flash", "2x / 4x Cut", "Item" and "W-Item".

The obvious downside to this is the fact that when you use an item on a
teammate, such as an Elixir, you'll also then proceed to attack that
character. All Support Materia that can be paired with Master Command this
way are "Added Cut", Steal as Well" and "HP Absorb"

Interestingly enough, if you were to pair HP Absorb with Master Command
whilst causing damage overflow, then that character would die. Read the next
section to learn all about damage overflow

|                                 THE BASICS:                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


A lot of people know about damage overflow, as it is possible to one-hit kill
Emerald WEAPON this way. You *cannot* one-hit kill Ruby, as its defence is
too high. When you cause damage overflow, you are actually reaching a value
so high midway through the calculations, that the damage output rolls into
the minus figures, which in turn increases the enemy's HP. This isn't the
same as healing an enemy, as a "healing flag" is activated when using
curative items.

If the enemy's HP is higher than it was prior to the attack, without the
healing flag being activated, then the game assumes you to have cause enough
damage to roll the enemy's HP into the minus figures, then back into the
positive range (so HP overflow), and in turn kills the enemy for you, as it
sees no other option.

When you cause overflow in this way you will either see one of two things: a
random damage value appear over the enemies head (anywhere between 1 and
9999), OR you will see a weird arrangement of numbers and symbols. Here is
the glitch in action against Emerald WEAPON:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJV4KB7F_xc

I will explain a lot more in detail exactly how this glitch works during the
mechanics section, however I am going to have to spend a little bit more time
now explaining more of the basics. Don't worry, I'm not going to get overly
technical with formulas (yet...)


+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                   POWER:                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


By default, Power is always 16, which is the equivalent of 1x normal Damage.
Only the Ultimate Weapons and Limit Breaks can modify the Power output, and
if Power becomes 32, then the character will deal 2x normal power, if Power
was 40 then they'll deal 2.5x normal Power and so on and so fourth.

 ULTIMATE WEAPONS:

 - Cloud, Red XIII, Cait Sith and Cid can all reach a maximum Power of 49
   (3.0625x normal Power - Max HP or MP).
 - Tifa can reach 64 Power (4x normal Power - full Limit Bar @ Lv 4).
 - Yuffie can reach 99 Power (6.25x normal Power - her Power is always equal
   the enemy's level).
 - Barret can reach 401 Power (25.0625x normal Power - 4,000,000 AP on weapon)
 - Vincent who is the strongest can reach 521 power (32.5625x normal Power -
   65,535 kills).

 LIMIT BREAKS:

 - Cloud's     2-2  Climhazzard can reach            70 Power (CAN   overflow)
 - Barret's    2-1  Grenade Bomb can reach           54 Power (CAN'T overflow)
 - Tifa's      Lv 4 Final Heaven can reach           42 Power (CAN'T Overflow)
 - Red XIII's  Lv 4 Cosmo Memory can reach          125 Power (CAN   overflow)
 - Yuffie's    Lv 4 All Creation can reach          128 Power (CAN   overflow)
 - Cait Sith's Lv 2 Toy Box (Comets) can reach       80 Power (CAN   overflow)
 - Vincent's   Lv 2 Gigadunk (Death Gigas) can reach 42 Power (CAN'T overflow)
 - Cid's       2-1  Hyper Jump can reach             56 Power (CAN'T overflow)

Aeris's Princess Guard is the only Ultimate Weapon that doesn't modify Power,
it only modifies Damage output (3x normal *damage* if 2 allies are dead),
however the modification will occur after the formulas have had a chance to
overflow, which is why she cannot (overflow). The same applies to the
Yoshiyuki, Master Fist and Powersoul. None of her Limit Breaks deal damage.


THERE ARE *2* OCCASIONS WHERE DAMAGE OVERFLOW CAN OCCUR:


+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                            BASE DAMAGE OVERFLOW:                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Basically, when you attack the damage figure is modified to be capped at
9999, however the cap is (almost) the final thing to occur. The *actual*
damage output itself can be much higher than 9999, and if the initial
*projected* damage output exceeds 262,144 HP AT BASE LEVEL (prior to
modifiers such as Critical etc.), then the enemy will be killed in one-hit,
ALTHOUGH overflow would have already occurred prior to 262,144 being
calculated, and as such that figure cannot be reached.

This occurs after the character's Attack, Level, Power, the enemy's Defence,
and the Hero Drink count have been taken into consideration, but prior to any
further modification. This projected figure is referred to in this guide as
*Base Damage*.

It is possible for Power to be too high (accompanied by enough Hero Drinks),
thereby rolling the negative damage back into the positive, and cancelling
out the BASE DAMAGE overflow altogether.

This is the earliest stage in which overflow can occur. Again, I will go into
more depths how the maths behind how it works further down, but just know for
now that BASE DAMAGE overflow requires *higher* Power to trigger negative
damage than RANDOM VARIATION overflow (and only Barret and Vincent can cause
BASE DAMAGE overflow).

The min Power required to cause BASE DAMAGE overflow is *138*


+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         RANDOM VARIATION OVERFLOW:                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


If overflow fails to occur at BASE DAMAGE, then there is a second opportunity
for overflow to occur at the RANDOM VARIATION stage, after modifiers such as
Critical, Berserk and Back-Damage have been taken into consideration. The
Power required for RANDOM VARIATION overflow to occur is much lower than it
is needed for BASE DAMAGE overflow, and one can overflow at just *46* Power.

Due to the fact that random variance has entered the equation (the part that
certifies that you don't hit with the same damage output twice), with 46
Power you will only have a chance of causing damage overflow; 49 Power will
guarantee overflow. When calculating RANDOM VARIATION overflow, you will
always have a range of Power figures to play with; the lower figure is the
Power req to stand a small chance of causing overflow, and the higher figure
is the Power req to guarantee overflow every time.

AFTER Critical, Berserk and/or Back Damage has been considered, your damage
output will need to be 524,888 to have a chance of causing overflow, or
559,025 to certify overflow.
BEFORE Critical, Berserk and/or Back Damage have been considered, the
required damage to overflow could be as little as 87,381.

Most people are under the impression that only Vincent and Barret can cause
damage overflow, as they are the only two that can one-hit Emerald, but due
to the low Base Damage value required to trigger RANDOM VARIATION, all
characters bar Aeris can overflow under the right conditions. Remember that
the enemies defence plays a big part in the equation, as does the amount of
Hero Drinks and damage modifiers used.

Ultimate Weapons:

Cloud, Cid, Red XIII, Cait Sith and Tifa can ONLY cause overflow by using all
three positive modifiers - Critical, Berserk & Back Damage

Limit Breaks:

Only Cloud, Red XIII, Yuffie and Cait Sith cause overflow, and they must use
Critical & Back Damage (you cannot use a Limit Break whilst in Berserk).


Also, it is possible for BASE DAMAGE overflow and RANDOM VARIATION overflow
to happen simultaneously, thereby negating damage overflow altogether. More
below.


+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              DAMAGE MODIFIERS:                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


It is important to understand the way in which the damage is affected. The
following is listed in the sequence in which it affects the damage formula.


BASE DAMAGE:


 - HERO DRINKS:
     These will raise a players Attack, Defence, Magic and Magic Defence by
     30%, and can stack for a maximum of 100% (4 Hero Drinks). These values
     will exceed their natural caps, so a player with 255 Attack going into
     battle will have 510 Attack after 4 Hero Drinks.

 - ULTIMATE WEAPONS:
     The Ultimate Weapons will directly affect the Power output.

 - LIMIT BREAKS
     Limit Breaks will also directly affect the Power output, but WILL NOT I
     repeat WILL NOT stack with the Ultimate Weapons. If you use a Limit
     Break, then the power boost from the weapons are ignored.

 - ENEMY'S DEF:
     Naturally the enemy's Defence plays a huge part in the formula, and the
     absolute maximum an enemy's Defence can be before overflow becomes
     unreachable is 421. There is only one enemy who's Def is greater than
     421, and that's Ruby (480). It is impossible for overflow damage to
     occur against an enemy who's Def is 422 or greater, UNLESS you could fit
     back-damage into the equation, which is only theoretical, but even then
     the maximum Def would be 466.

     The 2nd highest Defence in the game is Ying, with 420 Def. It is only
     just possible to overflow against Ying with Vincent who has had 65,408
     kills or more (cannot exceed 65,535), Lv 99, 255 Attack, 4 Hero Drinks,
     Critical and Berserk, and even then you would have a random chance of
     overflowing.

The above modifiers, along with the player's level, are the only things that
affect the initial Base Damage calculation, and if overflow occurs during
BASE DAMAGE, then none of the subsequent modifiers will matter (unless
Critical, Berserk and/or Back-Damage cause a second overflow to occur,
thereby negating the first overflow).

If Power is too low to incur an overflow during BASE DAMAGE calculations,
then the following modifiers will come into play, potentially causing
overflow at the RANDOM VARIATION stage:

 - CRITICAL HITS:
     These will deal 2x normal damage. Having a very high Luck will help (but
     not guarantee) a critical hit.

 - BERSERK:
     In this Status you will deal 1.5x normal damage. You can either equip a
     Fury Ring, cast a War Gong mid-battle, or cast Berserk from the Mystify/
     Master Magic Materia.

 - BACK DAMAGE:
     If you land an attack on an enemy with its back to you, then you will
     perform 2x normal damage. This can occur during a "preemptive strike",
     or a "side attack".

                 BERSERK & BACK DAMAGE = 3x Damage Modifier
                    BERSERK & CRITICAL = 3x Damage Modifier
                BACK DAMAGE & CRITICAL = 4x Damage Modifier
       BERSERK, BACK DAMAGE & CRITICAL = 6X Damage Modifier

     Random Variation overflow *CANNOT* occur with just 2x Damage; 3x damage
     or more is required.

There are also a number of negative modifiers that will reduce the damage
output. Note that the Row Check is performed after Berserk but before Back
Damage; all others occur after Back Damage (in sequence). These are:

 (player and/or enemy) BACK ROW     = 0.5x  Damage (does not stack)
               (enemy) DEFEND       = 0.5x  Damage
              (player) FROG         = 0.25x Damage
              (player) SADNESS      = 0.7x  Damage
           (Slash-All) SPLIT DAMAGE = 0.66x Damage
               (enemy) BARRIER      = 0.5x  Damage
              (player) MINI         = 0     Damage (+1)

After all these modifications take place, random variation will occur, which
will modify the damage output to anywhere between 93.77% (3841/4096) and 100%
(4096/4096) of normal power. It's during this calculation that we have
potential for overflow, and this is the reason why we end up with a range of
Power figures in which RANDOM VARIATION overflow can occur on.

 NOTES - *After* Random Variation, the Elemental checks begin. Attacking an
         enemy that is weak to a particular Element with that Element
         equipped to your weapon would *not* help to cause damage overflow.

       - If you had HP Absorb equipped with Master Command, then you would
         also kill yourself when causing damage overflow (unless you were
         using Limit Breaks).

       - By default, you have a 16/256 (6.25%) chance of landing a
         "Pre-emptive Strike". This is increased by the Pre-emptive
         Materia,and they can stack for a total of 85/256 (33.2%) chance:

           Lv 1 Pre-emptive: +16/256
           Lv 2 Pre-emptive: +22/256
           Lv 3 Pre-emptive: +28/256
           Lv 4 Pre-emptive: +34/256
           Lv 5 Pre-emptive: +48/256

         A Lv 5 Pre-emptive Materia will also grant you an Ambush Alert
         bonus, which halves the chance of receiving all Back Attacks and
         Pincer Attacks.

         Not all battles have a "Pre-emptive Strike" chance. A list of every
         enemy that can be back attacked can be found below.



OK, THAT'S ENOUGH ABOUT THE BASICS, HERE'S HOW TO DO THE GLITCH FOR YOURSELF:

 NOTES - If Vincent was to exceed *424* Power with *4 HERO DRINKS* (53,120
         kills), then the overflowed figure would roll back into the positive
         range, and overflow would then be negated.

       - If Vincent was to exceed *470* Power with *3 HERO DRINKS* (59,008
         kills), then the overflowed figure would roll back into the positive
         range, and the damage overflow glitch would then be negated.

After the value has rolled back into the positive, with maximum Power on
Vincent it would be impossible for Random Variation to then send the figure
back into negative overflow, as you would need to cause back damage to
Emerald as well as Critical and Berserk, which cannot happen as Emerald is
always facing you.

If a lv 99 Vincent had exactly 425 Power (between 53,120 and 53,247 kills)
whilst using four Hero Drinks (510 Attack), then his final damage output
would be between 545 and 582 HP worth of damage against Emerald, without
Critical etc.

 NOIES - Bear in mind that Random Variance will randomly deplete your damage
         output by as little as 0% and as much as 6.23% (so you're hitting for
         between 93.77% and 100% of normal power), which is why there is a
         range of Power values in which you'll have a chance of causing
         overflow (but not definitely).

       - It is *impossible* to cause overflow at the RANDOM VARIATION stage
         with just a critical against Emerald, as your Power would need to be
         higher that 213 to do so, which means that the damage would have
         already overflowed at base level.

Here is where it starts to get really interesting:

There is an overlapping set of Power values, where if you were to cause
overflow at BASE DAMAGE level against Emerald, *as well* as hitting for a
critical hit and being in Berserk, you would also trigger an overflow at the
RANDOM VARIATION stage, which would then in turn out cancel out the overflow
altogether!

 NOTE - You would keep hitting Emerald for 9999 HP, until one of your
        Critical hits failed, in which case BASE DAMAGE overflow would then
        kill Emerald un-interrupted.

There is actually another point in the calculations in which overflow could
occur at the random variation stage, possibly even two, however they are not
necessary to cite, and can be quite difficult to work out, especially when
base damage overflow and random variation overflow occur simultaneously.

I have to start using formulas now. Sorry!

|                Max   = 521 Power (65,535 kills)                            |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Well, technically speaking, Vincent's power level will max out at 65,408
Kills (511 * 128 = 65,408). Every 128 kills that Vincent gets increases his
Power by 1.

  With       0  kills Vincent's Power =  10  (62.5%    of regular damage)
  With     768  kills Vincent's Power =  16  (100%     of regular damage)
  With   2,816  kills Vincent's Power =  32  (200%     of regular damage)
  With   4,992  kills Vincent's Power =  49* (306.25%  of regular damage)
  With   6,912  kills Vincent's Power =  64  (400%     of regular damage)
  With  11,392  kills Vincent's Power =  99  (601.88%  of regular damage)

  * The reason I've chosen 49 Power instead of 48 is because Cloud, Cid, Cait
    Sith and Red XIII can all reach 49 max Power. Tifa can reach 64. Yuffie
    can reach 99.

The creature with the lowest Defence is the Bizarre Bug, which has 0 Def
whilst in its flying mode. It is also possible to land a Back Attack against
them, meaning that they are the creature that require the lowest Power (46)
to cause Random Variation overflow against. For Vincent, that's 4,608 kills.

The lowest Power required to cause Base Damage overflow is 138. Against the
flying Bizarre Bug (0 Def) requires 16,384 kills.

Vincent cannot cause overflow using a Limit Break.

Vincent can overflow on every single enemy in the game except for Ruby. It is
possible to check how many kills Vincent has. *Remember*, unless otherwise
stated, all calculations assumes Lv 99 and 255 Attack:

 - Against the Master Tonberry.

    The Master Tonberry will counter attack every other time it is hit with
    Everyone's Grudge. The formula for this attack is quite simply:

    [Number of Enemy's Killed by Target] * 10

    So this is only good for measuring the first 1000 kills, after that
    you'll have to use Ruby Weapon.

 - Against Ruby Weapon.

    Given the fact that Ruby has incredibly high Def (480), we can calculate
    how many kills Vincent has by dealing a regular, normal attack with
    absolutely no modifiers such as Hero Drinks, Berserk etc (other than
    Critical):

     NOTE - Given the way in which Random Variation works, your kill count
            could be as little as 128 and as much as 2304 LESS than the
            figures shown below; the higher the Power, the higher the value
            could be out by.

|____________________________________________________________________________|

You cannot measure your kill counted once it exceeds 37,888 without using
negative modifiers, so if you wanted to continue to measure your kill count
past this point then you would have to start using:

 Sadness = 0.7x  normal damage
    Frog = 0.25x normal damage

Remember that there is a greater range of variation in which you kill could
be out by (LESS than the values shown).

Again, Random Variation may throw you off here by as much as 4351 kills! You
could deal 4256 HP with as little as 61,184 (488 Power). It's very difficult
to know when you've maxed out Vincent; you'll know definitively if you've
reached 65535 kills when you manage to hit Ruby whilst in Frog for 4539 HP,
but you'll only have a 1/256 chance of that happening. It is also possible to
measure your kills against Ying.

Of course, we are talking about absurd amount of kills with Vincent to reach
his maximum damage potential, and only the hardcore or the hackers will be
able to see Damage Overflow with Vincent in action. With Barret however, far
less grinding is required...

|____________________________________________________________________________|

While the Underwater Materia will gain AP even though the AP count isn't
displayed, the AP that it amasses will *not* contribute to the Power
modification.

Here is a list of the Materia that requires the most AP to master:

  Knights of Round - 500,000 AP
  Magic Counter    - 300,000 AP
  Bahamut Zero     - 250,000 AP
  Typoon           - 250,000 AP
  Hades            - 250,000 AP
  W-Item           - 250,000 AP
  W-Summon         - 250,000 AP
  W-Magic          - 250,000 AP

Naturally 8 KOTR Materias is the max you can boost Barret's Power by, however
you'll only need a minimum of 1,410,000 ~ 1,500,000 AP to cause overflow
against Emerald with 4 Hero Drinks, Berserk & Critical, or 2,120,000 AP to
cause overflow with just 4 Hero Drinks.

Against the Bizarre Bug (0 Def, flying form), Barret only needs 450,000 AP on
his weapon with maximum damage modification (6x). Barret can overflow against
all creatures apart from Ying and Ruby Weapon.

Barret cannot overflow using any Limit Breaks

With a level 4 Limit Break and a full Limit bar, Tifa will deliver 4x regular
Power. Note that a full bar constitutes as 255 units, a half filled bar is
127 units, and an empty bar is 0 units. Because of this weird formula, Tifa's
Premium Heart isn't used very often as an empty Limit gauge will result in HP
damage in their hundreds. If you are using the Premium Heart, then commands
such as Deathblow paired with Added Cut are recommended.

The Highest Def that Tifa can cause overflow on is 144 (11/256) or 120
(100%). Tifa cannot overflow without maximum modification - Lv 99, 255
Attack, 4 Hero Drinks, Critical, Berserk and Back Damage.

As with Tifa, the only way in which these four characters can overflow is
with maximum modification (Berserk, Critical, Back Damage, 4 Hero Drinks, Lv

|                                                                            |

|                Max   = 99 Power (Against Emerald Weapon)                   |
|____________________________________________________________________________|


Yuffie is by far the most complicated to try to work out, as her Power is
equal to the enemy's Level. If multiple hits are targeted, then an average
level is taken. This gives Yuffie a maximum Power level of 99, however the
greater the enemies level, the greater their Defence usually is.

After a thoroughly investigating, I can say that there are no enemies that
Yuffie can overflow against using her Ultimate Weapon, although she can
overflow against a number of enemies using her Lv 4 limit Break, All Creation
(which has the highest Power mod of all Limit Breaks).


+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                LIMIT BREAKS:                               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Remember, you cannot cause Random Variation overflow with just 2x damage,
which means you need to combine Critical, Berserk and/or Back Damage. Seeing
as Limits cannot be used in Berserk, you can only cause Limit Break overflow
via a Critical and Back-Damage (and 4 Hero Drinks).


Cloud: 2-2 Climhazzard (70 Power)

Cloud can only just about cause overflow against an enemy that has 8 Def or
lower (random chance).


Cait Sith: Slots, Toy Soldier or Toy Box (Comets) (80 Power)

Cait can overflow against any enemy that has 71 Def or lower although 42 Def
or lower is req to guarantee overflow every time. Trying to get the desired
slots can be a real pain though...


Red XIII: Lv 4 Cosmo Memory (125 Power)

Red can overflow against any enemies that has 230 Def (random) or 211 Def
(guaranteed).


Yuffie: Lv 4 All Creation (125 Power)

Yuffie has the strongest Limit Break, and can overflow against any enemies
that has 236 Def (random) or 218 Def (guaranteed).

I've purposely withheld on getting too technical with formulas, until now
that is. If strings of binary and mathematical formulas make you squirmish,
then look away; I'm going to try to explain exactly how, why and when this
glitch occurs. Well, to be quite honest, you won't find it to be too overly
technical if you've got a good head for numbers; I myself am not a
mathematician!

During this section I am going to have to re-cap on some of the points I've
already made, but I will be doing so in much greater detail than previously.

BDO = Base Damage Overflow
RVO = Random Variation Overflow

If you don't know a great deal about binary architecture, then the most
important thing to note for now is that 32 bits of binary hold a value range
of 0 ~ 4,294,967,295 (2^32). Overflow occurs at the mid-way point; when we
exceed the 31 bit integer limit (2^31), and the left-most integer rolls over
from 0 to 1:

|____________________________________________________________________________|

What you're looking at is *unsigned* binary. FFVII DOES NOT use *unsigned*
binary when calculating the damage formula, as the overflow glitch would not
occur if it did. The reason being, when the 32 bit limit of 4,294,967,295
(2^32) was reached, the figure would simply roll back over to 0, which means
you will still be dealing normal positive damage, capped at 9999.

The Damage Overflow glitch ONLY occurs when negative damage is dealt.

The ONLY way to deal negative damage is to treat the string of binary as
*signed*, which is exactly how FFVII treats it. This gives us a different
value range from unsigned binary: -2,147,483,648 ~ 2,147,483,647. This is how
the damage value is treated when signed binary exceeds 2^31:
 ____________________________________________________________________________

| (Signed)                                                                   |
|                                                                            |
| 0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110  =  2,147,483,646                  |

|____________________________________________________________________________|

With *signed* binary, the very left most bit isn't treated in the same way as
unsigned binary. When the left most bit rolls over to 1, the number is then
flipped as a negative, and starts counting forwards to 0 again:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |

|____________________________________________________________________________|

So basically, the way in which all this ties in with the battle formulas in
FFVII is as follows: if at any point during the calculations we exceed 2^31
(2,147,483,648), we will cause overflow to occur, and in doing so we will
deal negative damage to the opponent, which will kill it instantly. What
happens when you try to subtract using a minus value? You turn the
subtraction into addition, and the enemy's HP is then increased. This is the
reason the glitch occurs.

There are two separate occasions in which overflow can occur; once as the
base damage calculations are being applied, and then again a 2nd time as
random variation is being worked out (the formula that basically prevents
your attacks dealing the same amount of HP every hit). It is possible for the
two to overlap, thereby cancelling each other out (things start to get really
complicated at that point).

With high enough values thrown into the calculations, it is possible to
overflow again into the positive range (2^32), and then again into the
negative (2^32 + 2^31) and then again into the positive (2^33)

EVERY CALCULATION WILL TREAT A VALUE AS BINARY INTEGER, AND AS SUCH THE VALUE
WILL *ALWAYS* GET ROUNDED DOWN WHEN USING DIVISION!!!

   ______________
 //              \\
 || HEALING FLAG ||
 \\______________//


There are many games out there that will treat negative damage as healing. If
FFVII were one of those games, then the glitch would still occur, however
instead of killing the enemy in one shot, you'd be curing it instead. FFVII
however *DOES NOT* use negative damage to heal an enemy. Instead, when you
cast a curative spell/item, such as Cure, the game still treats this as
normal damage, however a "Healing Flag" is then activated that the game
recognises further into the calculation, and then flips the damage into
healing damage, as well as changing the colour of the digits from white to
green. This check is performed during the Elemental checks (after Random
Variation), and uses the same flag as the "Absorb" Elemental resistance.

When you use a Curative spell or item, the value flips from normal damage to
healing damage because every single bit (including the 31st-bit 'minus flag')
is flipped; all 1's become 0's, and all 0's become 1's:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
|   Hi- Potion:                                                              |
|                                                                            |
|   500 = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1111 0100                            |
|  -501 = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0000 1011                            |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Then 1 is added, so you end up subtracting -500 HP from the Target, thereby
healing that Target by 500 HP. The game considers this to be normal, as the
healing flag check has been activated.

So, when we deal negative damage to the enemy thereby increasing its HP
*without* the healing flag being activated, the game then THINKS that you
have done so much damage that you have basically overflowed the enemy's HP
all the way past the negative 2^31 integer, and back into the positive again.
At this point, the game sees no other logical option than to just kill the
enemy for you.

As listed in the previous section regarding the Master Command glitches, it
is possible to pair HP Absorb with Master Command to heal your HP, even when
you use your basic commands, such as attack. If your damage output had
overflowed into the minus figures however, then the HP that was absorbed
would also be flipped. In this instance, the healing flag is up, however the
player's HP is less than it was previously. Again, the game by default kills
the player automatically, as it sees it as the only logical thing to do.

By default, Power is always 16, which equals 1x normal Power. The only
weapons that can modify Power are the Ultimate Weapons, excluding Aeris's
Princess Guard, which Modifies Damage AFTER the calculations have had their
chance to overflow. The Yoshiyuki, Powersoul and Master Fist also affect
Damage and not Power, and as such cannot overflow.

Limit breaks can also modify Power, however the modification will not stack
with the Ultimate Weapons; if you use a Limit Break then you only gain an
increase in Power from the Limit break, and the weapon's Power modifier will
not be considered.

Here are the best (physical) Limit Breaks for each character:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |

Seeing as you cannot use a Limit Break whilst in Berserk, you can only use
Critical and Back Damage (combined) to cause overflow via a Limit Break. The
lowest Power requirement to overflow under these conditions is *69*, and as
such Barret, Tifa Vincent and Cid cannot cause Limit Break damage overflow.

So then, it is during this calculation that we have our first opportunity to
overflow. If the damage output here is too low, then you'll have a second
chance to overflow at the random variation stage.

| The formula looks like this:                                               |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|           X = Level + Attack / 32                                          |
|           Y = Level * Attack / 32                                          |
|           Z = (X * Y) + Attack                                             |
|           D = (512 - Target's Defence) * Z * Power  (Overflow opportunity) |
| Base Damage = D / 8192                                                     |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

| The formula could also be displayed as:                                    |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|     Att Mod = [(Level + Attack) / 32] * [(Level * Attack) / 32] + Attack   |
|     Def Mod = 512 - Target's Def                                           |
|                                                                            |
| Base Damage = (Att Mod * Def Mod * Power) / 8192                           |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| If (Att Mod * Def Mod * Power) exceeds 2^31, overflow will occur.          |
|                                                                            |
| NOTE - "Damage / 8192" is not actually a division as such, instead it is a |
|        "right bit-shift" by 13 (2^13 = 8192), which isn't quite the same   |
|        as division. This is the root cause of the Damage Overflow glitch.  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

So then, we need to break this formula down into two parts. Let's look at
"Att Mod", or "Z" calculation. As mentioned, all calculations are based on
the assumption that a player is level 99, and has 255 Attack. Also as
mentioned, all values are integers, and will *always* get rounded down when
dividing.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| X = (99 + 255) / 32  = 11                                                  |
| Y = (99 * 255) / 32  = 788                                                 |
| Z = (11 * 788) + 255 = 8923                                                |
|                                                                            |
| OR                                                                         |
|                                                                            |
| Att Mod = [(99 + 255) / 32] * [(99 * 255) / 32] + 255 = 8923               |
|____________________________________________________________________________|


Remember, a Hero Drink will increase your Attack by 30% with each use (non-
compounding). So, 1 Hero Drink = 1.3x Attack; 2 Hero Drinks = 1.6x Attack; 3x
Hero Drinks = 1.9x Attack; and finally 4 Hero Drinks caps your Attack at 200%.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| HERO DRINK MODIFICATION:                                                   |
|                                                                            |
| 4 Hero Drinks  =  510 Attack  =  30,473 ATT MOD                            |
| 3 Hero Drinks  =  484 Attack  =  27,490 ATT MOD                            |
| 2 Hero Drinks  =  408 Attack  =  19,338 ATT MOD                            |
| 1 Hero Drinks  =  331 Attack  =  13,643 ATT MOD                            |
| 0 Hero Drinks  =  255 Attack  =   8,923 ATT MOD                            |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

So, we can now move onto the next stage of Base Damage calculation, which is
where overflow will occur. This happens when (Att Mod * Def Mod * Power) is
equal to or greater than 2^31 (2,147,483,648).

*IF* overflow hadn't occurred after exceeding 2^31 (because *unsigned*
integers were being used), then you would have been looking at a *projected*
base damage output of 262,144.   (2,147,483,648 / 8192 = 262,144)

Let's work backwards, assuming that Vincent has used 4 Hero Drinks (30,473
Att Mod), and has had 65,535 kills (521 power) to work out what the highest
enemy's Def Vincent can cause BDO on:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Highest Defence Vincent can cause BDO against:                             |
|                                                                            |
| 2,147,483,648 / 30,473 / 521 = 135 + 1 = 136                               |
| 512 - 136 = 376                                                            |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

376 is the highest Def in which Vincent can cause BDO on. Remember that RVO
requires less Power to activate than BDO. Also remember that you'll *always*
need to add 1 to the figure as shown above when calculating the *minimum*
value (but not the max value). This is due to the fact that integers always
get rounded down.

The last thing to talk about is the range in which BDO occurs. Naturally we
will overflow if (Att Mod * Def Mod * Power) is equal to or greater than 2^31
(2,147,483,648), but what happens when it exceeds 2^32 (4,294,967,296)?

Let's look at Emerald Weapon:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Overflowing against Emerald into the negative:                             |
|                                                                            |
| Emerald Weapon's Def = 180.                                                |
|            512 - 180 = 332 Def Mod                                         |
|         4 Hero Drink = 30,473 Att Mod                                      |
|                                                                            |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 332 / 30,473 = 212 + 1 = *213* (Remember to add 1)  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

213 is the Power required to cause Base Damage Overflow against Emerald. BUT:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Overflowing against Emerald back into the positive:                        |
|                                                                            |
| 2^32 (4,294,967,296) / 332 / 30,473 = *424* (DO NOT add 1 here)            |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

The range of Power values in which overflow will occur on against Emerald
(using 4 Hero Drinks) is 213 - 424. If your Power is 425 or more, you will
roll over back into the positive range. Vincent with 425 Power (53,120 kills)
and 4 Hero Drinks (30,463 Att Mod), will deal between 545 and 582 HP worth of
normal damage to Emerald, without other modifiers such as Critical or Berserk
affecting the formula.

Against very low levelled enemies such as the Bizarre Bug (0 Def in its
flying form), it is possible to overflow into the negative again, past 2^32 +
2^31 (6,442,450,944). In fact, the figure (8,128,733,696) falls just short of
2^33 (8,589,934,592); IF it had exceeded 2^33, then it would overflow AGAIN
into the positive.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Let's figure out when overflow would occur a third time against the        |
| Bizarre Bug in its flying form (0 Def = 512 Def Mod) to send the figure    |
| back into the negative, shall we:                                          |
|                                                                            |
| 2^32 + 2^31 (6,442,450,944) / 30,473 / 512 = 412 + 1 = 413                 |
|        2^33 (8,589,934,592) / 30,473 / 512 = 550 (don't add 1)             |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

Seeing as Barret maxes out at 401, only Vincent can overflow a third time at
BDO level back into the negative value range (413 Power or more). Vincents
Power cannot exceed 521, therefore he cannot exceed 2^33, and cannot then
overflow back into the positive once more.

Remember, as mentioned, when you throw RVO into the mix, you reach values as
high as 24,290,918,400 (11 cycles of 2^31). Things start to get *really*
complicated when BDO and RVO overlap each other.

So, to summarise Base Damage overflow:

 NOTE - The enemy with the lowest Defence in the game is the Bizarre Bug
        whilst in its flying form (0 Def). Sephiroth also has 0 Def, but that
        is a scripted battle. The second highest Def is the Hell House (2
        Def).

Once the Base Damage value has been calculated, (Def Mod * Att Mod * Power /
8192), the game will perform a series of checks before it gets to the Random
Variation formula, which is where overflow has its second opportunity to
occur. All checks that occur after Random Variation (such as Elemental) will
not affect the formula in a way that could cause overflow to happen again.

Here are the checks that are performed, in the order that they are checked,
after Base Damage but before Random Variation:

|       (So, if both attacker and target are in the Back Row, damage is      |

| * There are three enemies that has a Back Damage modifier that differs     |
|   from 16 (2x damage):                                                     |
|                                                                            |
|  - Air Buster = 40 (5x Damage)                                             |
|  - Aps        = 32 (4x Damage)                                             |
|  - Acrophies  = 64 (8x Damage)                                             |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

It is impossible to hit encounter the Acrophies with a Preemptive strike, so
unfortunately we can't utilise its high Damage Modifier.

Remember that most random encounters have a 16/256 (6.25%) chance of being
"Pre=emptive Strike", and the Pre-Emptive Materia can stack with each other
to increase that value to as much 85/256 (33.2%).

 - Lv 1 Pre-emptive: +16/256
 - Lv 2 Pre-emptive: +22/256
 - Lv 3 Pre-emptive: +28/256
 - Lv 4 Pre-emptive: +34/256
 - Lv 5 Pre-emptive: +48/256

A Lv 5 Pre-emptive Materia will grant an Ambush alert bonus, which halves the
chance of Back Attacks and Ambushes.

There are 5 Bosses that can be encountered via a Pre-emptive Strike, and
these are: Aps, Jenova Birth, Turks (Gongaga), Snow (Great Glacier), and
Turks (Midgar re-visited).

        And then after all this, we finally get to **RANDOM VARIATION**

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
|  Random Variation:                                                         |
|                                                                            |
|       Damage = [(Random number between 3841 ~ 4096) * Damage] / 4096       |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| This formula means that you will deal anywhere between 93.77% (3841/4096)  |
| and 100% (4096/4096) of your Damage to that point.                         |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

 NOTES - As with the Base Damage formula, the " / 4096 " is not actually
         regular division, but rather a bit shift right by 12, which is why
         overflow occurs here (2^12 = 4096).

       - Naturally, the only modifiers that we are going to be looking at are
         the positive ones; Critical (2x), Berserk (1.5x) and Back Damage (2x)


So we find ourselves at another point in which overflow is possible. If
[(Random number between 3841 ~ 4096) * Damage] is equal to or greater than
2^31, overflow will occur. This means, that your damage output prior to
Random Variation would need to be in the range of 524,288 (Rnd) ~ 559,095
(100%).
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| This means, that your damage output prior to Random Variation would need   |
| to be in the range of 524,288 (Rnd) ~ 559,095 (100%).                      |
|                                                                            |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 4096 = 524,288                                      |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 3841 = 559,094 (+1)                                 |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

ALWAYS bear in mind that when you cause Damage overflow via Random variation,
you will have a range of values:   2^31 / 4096 =   1/256 chance (Rnd)
                                   2^31 / 3841 = 256/256 chance

Also, notice how the damage output requirement here (after damage modifiers)
(524,288) is twice that of BDO (262,144)? That's because the bit shift
operation is one less that than it was previously; Base damage is a bit shift
right by 13 (8192), whereas Random Variation is a bit shift right by 12
(4096).

Prior to any damage modifiers taking effect, you're looking at a minimum base
damage output value range of 87,381 (Rnd) to 93,182 (100%) damage to cause
RVO, with Berserk, Critical and Back Damage.

IT IS *IMPOSSIBLE* TO CAUSE RANDOM VARIATION OVERFLOW WITH JUST A CRITICAL!

This is down to the fact that if you failed to overflow at Base Damage
calculation, then your Base Damage figure will be lower than 262,144. Seeing
as you need a minimum of 524,288 after damage modifiers to overflow at Random
Variation calculation, which is precisely twice 262,144, you will need MORE
than 2x Damage modifies to then exceed 524,288.
This means there are only three variations to look at:
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Berserk and Critical  or Back Attack - 3x Damage Modifier                  |
|             Critical and Back Attack - 4x Damage Modifier                  |
| Berserk and Critical and Back Attack - 6x Damage Modifier                  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

So, let's do some maths, shall we?

  4 x Hero Drinks (30,473 Att Mod), 0 Def (512 Def Mod):

  REMEMBER - BASE DAMAGE OVERFLOW WILL KICK IN AT *138* POWER, AND WHEN IT
             DOES, RVO WILL THEN NEGATE BDO!
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                            |
| Let's work out the LOWEST "range" of Power required to cause RVO for each  |
| modifier:                                                                  |
|                                                                            |
|   3X DAMAGE MODIFIER: (Critical / Back Attack & Berserk)                   |
|                                                                            |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 4096 / 3 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 92 PWR  (Rnd)  |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 3841 / 3 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 98 PWR  (100%) |
|                                                                            |
|   4X DAMAGE MODIFIER: (Critical & Back Attack)                             |
|                                                                            |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 4096 / 4 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 69 PWR  (Rnd)  |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 3841 / 4 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 74 PWR  (100%) |
|                                                                            |
|   6X DAMAGE MODIFIER: (Critical, Back Attack & Berserk)                    |
|                                                                            |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 4096 / 6 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 46 PWR  (Rnd)  |
| 2^31 (2,147,483,648) / 3841 / 6 * 8192 / 30,473 / 512 + 1 = 49 PWR  (100%) |
|                                                                            |
| So, if you had 46 Power, you would have a 11/256 chance of causing Random  |
| Variation Overflow (with Berserk, Back Damage, Critical, 4 Hero Drinks,    |
| and 0 Def on enemy), which is the minimum requirement to cause overflow    |
| (so all characters bar Aeris). If you had 49 Power, then you would         |
| overflow 100% of the time (with said conditions).                          |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

As with BDO, there is a point in which we will overflow back into the
positive range (when we exceed 2^32), however when BDO then kicks in and
overlaps with RVO, things start to get rather complicated. More below.

So, we can see that the lowest Power has to be *overall* to cause overflow is
46. It is absolutely impossible to cause overflow to an enemy with a Power of
45 or lower, EXCEPT for the 3 enemies that have special back damage
modifiers - Air Buster, Aps & Acrophies, the latter being the only random
encounter that you can face at any point in the game (but unfortunately you
cannot encounter it with its back to you).

Given that all characters except Aeris can reach a minimum Power of 49, all
characters can cause damage overflow at the Random Variation stage. Aeris's
Power cannot not exceed 16 when using the Princess Guard; instead, her damage
is multiplied by 2 or 3 depending according to allies are dead
(respectively), and this takes place *after* the random variation calculation.

Note that the above considers the Ultimate Weapons only (with 6x damage mod).
When talking about Limit Breaks, you can only overflow using 4x damage, and
as such *69* Power is the min required to overflow.

| 466 is the absolute maximum an enemies Def can be using Random Variation   |
| overflow (82/256 chance), or 463 to guarantee overflow. Back Attacks are   |
| not always achievable, which means that 421 Def is the highest with just   |
| Critical & Berserk (38/256 chance) or 415 to guarantee overflow.           |

The only enemies that have Defence over 400 is the Lost Number (Purple - 400
Def), Ying (420 Def) and Ruby Weapon (480 Def), meaning Ruby is the only
enemy that cannot be subjected to the Overflow glitch.

This last section tries to explain how complicated the maths can get when
Base Damage overflow and Random Variation overflow overlap.

Once you have literally just overflowed the 31st integer the negative value,
that value will be furthest away from 0. The higher the initial value, the
lower the negative number then becomes *from 0*, and even though you are
increasing the negative number, the resulting subsequent calculations made to
that number will be smaller, in terms of its distance from 0.

What this means, is that at the very point in which both overflows occur,
they will negate each other out, until of course the initial value has risen
enough to the point where the negative value after base damage is then small
enough to then prevent RVO from negating BDO. ...Yeah.

To be honest, I was going to spend some time trying to find a way of working
out when negative overflow will re-occur after both overflows have engaged,
however it became far too difficult to work out (for someone who isn't a
mathematician), so I stood down. What I did notice, is that when negative
overflow occurs again, the LOWER value becomes the 100% chance value, and the
HIGHER value becomes the rnd chance value..... just as an example how
inverted and complicated it all becomes!

A quick note about the Turks battle in Midgar. Both Reno and Rude will be in
the back row (1/2 damage), and Elena is scripted to turn around as soon as
the fight begins, so you cannot overflow against them I'm afraid....

|                                   NOTES:                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


 - There are 5 bosses that can receive a Pre-Emptive Strike that shouldn't
   have been able to. This is due to an error in coding; if an area has
   random encounters disabled, then the fight can *never* be a Pre-Emptive
   Strike. The developers knew this, and as such they have intently given
   many boss battles the "normal fight" flag, knowing that a Pre-Emptive
   Strike is impossible (normally, if an enemy is NON-preempt-able, then a
   special flag must be set which disables Pre-Emptive Strikes).

   If random encounters ARE enabled for a screen in which a boss is fought,
   then the dev's must remember to set the "Pre-Emptive Strike Disabled"
   flag. There are 5 examples where they have forgotten to do this:

     Aps
     Jenova Birth
     Turks (Gongaga)
     Snow (Alexander Cave)
     Turks (Midgar)


 - 3 enemies can receive higher then normal Back Damage (nut none will
   receive lower-than normal Back Damage):

     Air Buster (5x Damage)
     Aps (4x Damage)
     Acrophies

   Using this info for the purpose of overflow is only hypothetical of
   course, seeing as two of the enemies cannot be fought late game, and one
   of the enemies (Acrophies) cannot be Back-Attacked, which is a shame,
   because if it could then overflow could occur with a Def as little as 14,
   which means Aeris *could* overflow against it..... except Aeris will not
   be with us when we encounter the Acrophies!!!!!


 - This is really handy to know. There HAS to be an enemy in the front row;
   the game cannot have an empty front row, the coding dis-allows it. Which
   means, if you wish to cause overflow but the enemy you are targeting is in
   the back row, you can quickly remove the enemies in the front row which
   will bring the back row to the front row.

   It's like this: There is no "Front Row" and "Back Row", it is only
   "Normal" and "Back Row (Status)". By default, an enemy's Row value is
   always set to 1, which dictates the enemy is "Normal". Any value greater
   than *THE LOWEST VALUE* is then given the Back Row Status. Let's say you
   have:

     Enemy W - 1 Row Value
     Enemy X - 2 Row Value
     Enemy Y - 2 Row Value
     Enemy Z - 3 Row Value

   Enemy W is in the front row and X, Y & Z are in the back row. If you kill
   enemy W, then X & Y become the front row enemies, while Z would remain in
   the back row until X & Y were destroyed.

   If an enemy is given a row value of 16, then they are given the "Cannot
   Reach" Status.


 - Enemies can cause overflow to you. Seriously! I haven't tried it, but here
   is a vid of it in action, although to set it up would be difficult as you
   would need to cast a Hero Drink on the enemy in the same manor you would a
   Hyper; by having a character select it that is about to become confused.
   Not to mention the fact that your Def/MDef stat would have to be low
   enough. I'm not doing the math (I've already done enough!!).

     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9k5OukD_HE

   In all honesty, I am unsure of the legitimacy of this vid, as I know
   hacks have been used. If someone manages to do it for themselves, be sure
   to let me know!!


 - In case you didn't already know by now, the best way to raise your
   character's Strength to 255 is to make use of the Extended W-Item glitch
   to gain Power Sources from the Screamer in Mt. Nibel. See the W-Item
   Glitch section above for more details. If you aren't a fan of using
   exploits (then why are you reading this section lol) you can Morph Power
   Sources legitimately from either the Heavy Tank (Gongaga Reactor) or the
   Unknown (Sunken Gelnika).


 - Ruby is the only enemy that you cannot overflow against. If you happen to
   be using a savegame editor such as Black Chocobo (link found in Section
   J - Special Thanks) then here's how to hex-edit to cause overflow to Ruby.

   In the Hex Editor, scroll down to line 03F0. the second value in (0x03F1)
   is Vincent's Level. If Vincent is Lv 99, then the value in hex will be 63.
   Change this value to FF to increase Vincent's Lv to 255. Tried and tested,
   it works! I haven't done any maths behind it, but I have a sneaky
   suspicion that base damage will be so great, that random variance could
   exceed 2^31 a number of times; so basically you will have a completely
   random chance with every hit!


 - First comes Base Damage, then the damage modifiers are considered. Then
   Random Variance plays its part, after which the Elemental checks are
   performed. Then the Reflect, then the "Miss" and "Death" chance, then the
   sanity cap (9999), then a check for immunities, followed by Peerless, then
   Petrify, and finally the 7777 Fever check.


 - It's probably handy to know exactly how the Critical chance formulas work,
   seeing as Criticals play a big part in causing overflow. First, Crit % is
   worked out:

     Crit% = [(Attacker's Luck + Attacker's Level - Target's Lv) / 4]

   Then, any weapon that increases Crit% is considered. After this, a random
   value will be pulled between 1 and 100. If Crit% is GREATER than this
   random value, a Critical hit is landed.


 - As is mentioned, equipping HP Absorb with Master Command whilst causing
   damage overflow will also kill the attacker. There is a way to change this
   set-up to our advantage! If you were to pair Elemental in your weapon with
   an Element that the enemy absorbs, you would instead cause healing
   overflow, which would completely replenish the enemy's HP. Pretty
   pointless, unless you have HP Absorb paired with Master Command, in which
   case your character's HP would also be replenished!

   You could also measure your damage output with a similar set-up. Equip HP<-
   >MP and also equip MP Absorb=Master Command. When you use MP Absorb, your
   MP will fill by 1% of the damage inflicted, however because the damage has
   overflowed the MP will be depleted instead of filled. The value that you
   see is 1% of the total damage dealt, so if your MP was drained by 3360,
   then your damage would be 336,000 (which is greater than 262,144).

   Here is a video that explains it in more depth:

     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npU18Kc9SZ0


 - Just to re-cap on something I've already highlighted, here is the rate in
   which the Pre-Emptive Materia will stack:

     Lv 1 Pre-emptive: +16/256
     Lv 2 Pre-emptive: +22/256
     Lv 3 Pre-emptive: +28/256
     Lv 4 Pre-emptive: +34/256
     Lv 5 Pre-emptive: +48/256

   The highest your Pre-emptive chance can reach is 85/256. Also, A Lv 5 Pre-
   emptive Materia will also grant you an Ambush Alert bonus, which halves
   the chance of receiving all Back Attacks and Pincer Attacks.

  A glitch could be good OR bad, however in this guide I have split the good
glitches (exploits) up from the bad glitches; the following is a list of
glitches you want to try to avoid. Note that there are some glitches that can
only be triggered by undergoing a lengthily process and are quite difficult
to set-up. I will not be citing such examples; the following glitches are
ones that you could possibly trigger by accident, and as such you want to try
to avoid!

Some glitches (such as the Spirit Stat Glitch) are hard-coded into the game
and are unavoidable!

 | *NOTES* |
 +---------+

ES-1 - BIG GUARD - Can be learnt from the shores of Corel Area, Gold Saucer
         Area or Gongaga Area. Must acquire the Manipulate Materia first.
ES-2 - AQUALUNG - To encounter the Harpy you must drive around the desert in
         your buggy (World Map), or equip Chocobo Lure and battle around the
         chocobo tracks.
   1 - BLACKSMITH - The first time you visit the weapon sellers house there
         will be no-one home. You must return after having acquired the Tiny
         Bronco, you can then exchange the Mythril for either a Gold Armlet
         or the Great Gospel.
ES-3 - FROG SONG - Be sure to have protection from Frog, such as a White Cape.
 S-1 - VAGYRISK CLAW - The Bagrisk can only be fought in the area just west
         of Cosmo Canyon, as the 'sunset effect' begins to fade. Also, the
         higher the level of the person stealing, the lower the chance you
         have of stealing the Vagyrisk Claw.
   2 - SHORTCUT - Once yo have obtained the Tiny Bronco you will be able to
         cut through the river near Nibelheim to emerge near Gongaga, and
         vice-versa.
   3 - CACTUS USLAND - Once you have obtained the Highwind you will be able
         to visit this small island to encounter the Cactuer. You can steal
         the Tetra Element from them.
   4 - LUCRECIA'S CAVE - Once you have obtained either a Green chocobo or the
         submarine, you can access Lucrecia's cave for some hidden story-line
         secrets and some goodies.
   5 - ANCIENT FOREST - You will be able to access the Ancient Forest once
         you have a Green chocobo, alternatively you can wait until Ultimate
         WEAPON has been defeated.
   6 - MATERIA CAVE -  Once you have a Black or Gold chocobo you can access
         the Materia Cave near North Corel.
   7 - SUNKEN GELNIKA - If you are having trouble finding it then bring your
         submarine to the point shown on the map and submerge to find the
         Gelnika. Be careful as Emerald could be sitting directly in front of
         it!
   8 - RUBY WEAPON - Will appear as a small red fin sticking out of the
         desert. It'll only appear once Ultimate WEAPON has been defeated,
         and you have engaged in one random battle.

                    To World Map and Icicle Inn


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                             If you'd taken the :-

    Left + Right path you would have landed at the entrance. Head north to
    continue on from the forest.

    Right + Left path you would have landed at the Lone Tree. Head south,
    then west to continue on from the forests.

    Left + Left path (as advised) you would have landed in the forest.

    Right + Right path you would have landed east of the entrance. Make your
    way through the south screen to arrive at the entrance then continue
    north to come to the forest

 1.) At the very north of the screen in the forests, you'll be able to pick up
     (A), the [MIND SOURCE]. Now head east two screens to 2.

 2.) To the north east of the screen you'll be able to pick up (B), the
     [POTION]. By not pressing O a second time, you can add one to your
     inventory whilst retaining the Potion's 'source'. Meaning, it'll still
     be there when you run back. Now head north west to 3.

 3.) You'll have to step on the ice blocks in a certain sequence here to be
     able to get to the other side. The same goes for on the way back. In the
     cave ahead you'll be able to find (C), the [SAFETY BIT] (be sure to get
     this).

              HEADING NORTH:                     HEADING SOUTH:

 4.) Picking a second 'infinite' potion as you return through section 3, make
     your way east two screens to the Lone Tree.

 5.) Heading east, make your way 4 screens up to the far eastern mountainside
     'split'.

 6.) Now head through the far eastern exit, this is a one way path that can
     only be travelled on from screen 5. Along the path on the second screen
     to the right you'll just about to be able to make out (D), the [ADDED
     CUT MATERIA] in the snow.

 7.) You should now emerge at the hot springs. MAKE SURE to examine the left
     side of it to 'touch it' as you won't be able to grab the Alexander
     Materia otherwise. Then make your way 3 screens to the north to come to
     the snow fields.

 8.) Every second or so press O to lay down a marker. When the wind throws
     you off direction, stop moving. Use the markers that you have placed to
     pick up your orientation. Firstly, head north to find and igloo type
     cavern containing (E) the [ALL MATERIA].

 9.) Now head out of the igloo and head east. After you've travelled through
     4 screens you'll find yourself on more mountain side paths. Head into
     the eastern cavern and remove Counter Attack. As long as you touched the
     hot springs earlier then you can fight the Snow here, and even though
     the music suggests a boss battle it's actually just the same Snow as
     listed above. Make sure to steal a Circlet from her. Once she has been
     defeated she'll leave behind (F), the [ALEXANDER MATERIA].

 10.) As long as you've managed to grab the Alexander Materia without passing
      out then you'll have succeeded in grabbing as much as I intended for
      you to grab. You can attempt to make your way over to the remaining
      Elixir on the far west side, but it's highly doubtful that you'll make
      it in time (although it is possible). There is an exploit you can make
      use of here, however. I suggest at this point either making your way
      back to the Snow Fields and then north to find Holzoff's cabin, or just
      running around until you pass out, you'll then awaken in his cabin.

      Once at the cabin, you'll have to listen to Holzoff's story to
      continue. After spending the night there head outside to hear Barret
      embarrass himself, then your teammates will join you. Head south back
      to the Snow Fields. When you head back out you'll have a fresh 544
      steps to play with.

 11.) From the Snow Fields head all the way to the west 3 screens to arrive at
      more cliff sides. Now make your way west 3 screens to arrive at a
      cavern that can be entered from both sides. the final item here, the
      [ELIXIR] (G) can be duplicated as many times as you please, as long as
      you don't pick up the source (exactly like the Potion we saw earlier,
      but unfortunately not the Mind Source).

      Press O once to have the message 'Received Elixir' appear, but DON'T
      press O a second time. Instead, run out of the cavern and back in
      again. The Elixir will still be there, and you'll have added one to
      your count. As long as you don't accidentally pick up the source of the
      eternal Elixir, then you'll be able to keep coming to this spot as many
      times as you like.

  As much as I love Final Fantasy VII, I have to admit that the game is like
Cloud in so many ways; it's virtually broken, and very few people know! (or
should I say knew...) This section is my way of moaning about the things that
need moaning about. Feel free to add your own rant by e-mailing me -
DynamixDJ@writeme.com. I will be sure to mention your name should you
contribute to this section.

!!SPOILER ALERT!! Be sure not to read this section unless you have completed
the game already.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.01 B - "This isn't just a reactor!"

During the first Boss sequence you will be told to 'Attack while its tails
up'! So, I attacked whilst its tail was up and it killed me. What gives?

O.k, so this is probably the oldest rant in the games history

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.03 B - Sector 4 Platforms

When you first meet President Shinra on the bridge of the reactor, he will
claim that Cloud was previously in Soldier... even though Cloud never was in
Soldier! Maybe he was just mistaken from the glow in Cloud's eyes, but
something about the way he said it suggests otherwise.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.06 B - Hojo's Laboratory

So what exactly was Hojo planning with Aeris and Red XIII??? It seems he was
trying to mate them to make a, erm, Red Cetra? Or Aeris XIII...

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.06 C - Escaping From Shinra

Sephiroth, upon meeting the Midgar Zolom - "Dammit! I left the damn Masamune
Blade back in the Shinra HQ! I'll just double back to fetch it..." Was
(Jenova) Sephiroth just very forgetful, or was he able to spawn more copies
of the Masamune blade as he did the first time (remember that it was actually
Jenova in the form of Sephiroth).

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.07 B - The Nibelheim Incident

How does Cloud remember so much of something if he wasn't actually there to
see it for himself? I'm talking about the part where Cloud waits outside the
reactor to guard Tifa whilst Zack and Sephiroth venture inside.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.09 C - Cargo Ship

Not a huge rant, but how exactly did the rest of Cloud's companions make it
onto the Cargo Ship? I just thought, imagine if they made a FF7 spin off where
they basically made the same game but through the eyes of another character,
say, Tifa! That would be cool...

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.10 B - Mt. Corel/North Corel

When Barret and Dyne look out to the village of Corel, they are supposed to
be looking at a desert followed by a horizon. So why then are they looking at
forests surrounded by mountains? Plus, Corel is half a continent away!!

Bumb - one speculation is that what they were supposed to be looking at,
before the story line had changed during development, was Gongaga. 'There was
an explosion at a reactor' doesn't specify which reactor exploded, and
originally this could have been referring to the ruined reactor in Gongaga.
Either way, the cinematics makes little sense whatsoever.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.11 A - Gold Saucer

When you board the Ropeway 'cart' you'll notice that the propellors are on
the upper side of the cart, but whilst the cinematics are playing on your
first visit you'll see that they are on the lower side. Then they'll be on
the upper side again when it boards at the Gold Saucer.

When you first approach the Battle Square (after recruiting Cait Sith) you
will be lead to believe that Barret has shot the place up. This will later be
clarified as being Dyne. WHY OH WHY (and how) would Dyne just 'hop' out of
prison, shoot a few people in the Battle Square, and then just jump back down
into the prison again? What the hell's all that about??

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.15 B - Shinra Mansion

This one has bugged me for a long, long time. When we see Sephiroth in the
basement of the Shinra Mansion (where we obtain the Destruct Materia), he
tells us to go through Mt. Nibel. Why? Sephiroth's next destination was the
Temple of The Ancients, and there is absolutely nothing waiting for us (that
Sephiroth knows about) on the other side of Mt. Nibel.

My personal theory of this has been that there was meant to be an additional
scene within the reactor itself, but due to the limitations of the PS1 disks,
they were forced to edit it out. Perhaps a small encounter with Sephiroth and
Cloud in the rooms with all the 'monster' tanks, where Sephiroth reveals a
small insight into Cloud's past, and mentions the Temple of The Ancients as
his next destination...

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.16 A - Meet the Astrona.... errr, I mean Captain, Cid!

...How  did the plane just take off all by itself?? That whole scene seems
pretty far-fetched.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.19 B - The Date

How exactly did Cloud work out that Sephiroth was after the Black Materia? As
I recall, the first mention of the Black Materia was upon Cloud's first
arrival to the Gold Saucer. If you speak to Dio, he will mention that a boy
of Cloud's age was asking about it. The second reference to the Black Materia
comes from the weapon seller south of Gongaga (where you exchange the
mythril). He talks about 'Ultimate Destructive Magic'. Cloud was then able to
piece the two together... how exactly? He must be a detective of some sorts
(Hot-Blooded Detective Joe).

During the date sequence, we learn of Cait Sith's true nature. We know that
he has Marlene held captive somewhere... but that whole side-story never
concludes! Do you think it's possible that Reeve just forgot about poor old
Marlene and she starved to death? And yes I'm aware that the little girl in
Kalm in the final cinematics is supposed to be Marlene, but that isn't
conclusive.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D1.21 B - Corral Valley/City of The Ancients

I'm not sure where to begin here.

1) When you approach the alter Aeris is facing the stairs, but while the FMV
   is playing she has her back to the stairs. Once the FMV has finished she
   is facing the stairs again.

2) Whilst Sephiroth is descending on to of Aeris he has no gloves, but right
   at the end as he plunges his sword in he is wearing gloves.

3) When we first approach the alter the floor is almost transparent. Then
   when the FMV begins we see that it is chequered like a chess board. Then it
   changes to being hard brown, like marble, then it changes back to
   transparent after the FMV has finished.

4) As Holy falls out of Aeris's hair, her Ribbon falls off, then it (the
   ribbon) is back in her hair afterwards.

5) The only line that Jenova has in the entire game has a spelling mistake -
   'beacause'.

6) When Cloud picks Aeris up she has her head to the right of Cloud, then
   when he drops into the water her head is to his left.

7) Did Cloud actually kill Aeris? I mean, she may have just been unconscious??
   Also, it seems weird how Cloud can float whilst carrying Aeris.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
     D2.11 A - The Final Frontier

Cloud and his companions went out of their way to stop the Shinra from
getting their hands on the Huge Materia as so that they could use them for
their own deeds. But... what if the Shinra's plan had succeeded? I mean, it
was a pretty good plan after all, and the Huge Materia isn't really necessary
for Cloud to defeat Sephiroth.

     D2.12 A - Bugenhagen's Laboratory

When you board the Highwind you can talk to Yuffie about her travel sickness.
This is quite hilarious as Cloud will talk to Yuffie as though he still
believes he was previously in Soldier! Maybe he was having a relapse, and his
mind is still sick and twisted (or maybe the dev's made (another) mistake).

     D3.03 C - Bizarro

When you kill Sephiroth you see blood dripping down his face. Why would they
show blood on Sephiroth but not Aeris?
