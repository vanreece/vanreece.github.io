                 Fort Condor Battle #5 - 5x Hi potions


  Make your way round the mountain side until you eventually come to a huge
observatory. **DO NOT drive past it**. If you do the buggy will breakdown and
you will not be able to complete one of the Fort Condor Battles. Park up just
outside and then enter the Cosmo Canyon, the place that Barret has always
dreamed of visiting (Best Bromance - make sure that he is in your party as
you enter)!

As you enter you'll find out that the Cosmo Canyon is actually a home-town of
one of your companions. If (Nanaki) was in your party when you had entered
then you'd have to choose another party member temporarily. Once inside you
could head up the far right ladder to stock up on a few items, but there is
nothing new here.

 NOTE - The Green Indicator within the item shop signifies that there is
        another part to the shop. We won't be able to access this however
        until Disk 2.

In the next house down in-between the two sets of ladders you'll find the inn
where you can rest for 100 gil. More importantly, you can examine the [Turtle
Paradise Poster #5] just to the left of the counter. Head to the back room on
the 2nd floor and examine the left hand side of the couch at the bottom for
an [Elixir].

Now head up the stairs on the left and talk to Red XIII. He'll explain a
little bit about himself, then your other two Party members will disperse.
Follow them up the stairs to a save point and  the [Turtle Paradise Poster
#4] just left of the counter. Don't bother with Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop for
now, we'll return here very shortly.

Head to the back of Tiger Lily's Shop to talk to Barret if you like (Best
Bromance - choose option 1, "Go on", then option 1, "And then"), then head to
the left of her shop and up two flights of stairs.

 NOTE - To exploit the aforementioned glitch to boost Barret's affection
        rating indefinitely, you would have to pick option 1 followed by
        option 2, then run out of the room and re-enter. Rinse and repeat.
        Again, don't exploit it too heavily as doing so would cause Barret's
        affection to exceed its limit, preventing the Best Bromance Trophy
        from popping.

The first shop on the right is the Materia Shop, again we'll return here very
soon (trust me). The second shop is a kitchen, nothing to do here just yet.
Then large door is sealed and the left exit leads to a viewpoint.

So, head up the ladder and into the observatory to talk to Red XIII and
Bugenhagen. After a short amount of conversing, you'll have to choose two
companions to accompany you. Head back down the ladders and run into the
kitchen (right of the big sealed door). Here you can talk to Cait Sith to
arrange your party (you could talk to any one of your teammates, Cait Sith
just happens to be the closest one to talk to).

Once you've selected your party (I chose Barret & Aeris) you can head back up
to the observatory to view Bugenhagen's machinery.

Once the lesson has finished make your way back down to the entrance to Cosmo
Canyon to find all of your comrades sat around a giant flame. Before heading
over to the flame yourself, head into the inn to talk to one of the elders to
learn a bit about the Ancients. This is the only time in the game you can
hear this dialogue.

Talk to all of everybody saving Red XIII till last. When you do talk to Red,
Bugenhagen will turn up wanting to show you something. Form a party and
follow him up to the big sealed door. When he asks you if you're ready, tell
him that you are. Once you have gone through the door **TURN AROUND!!!***
There's a few thing you'll want to do first:

 NOTE - If you only wanted to do 7 of the Fort Condor battles to obtain all
        of the unique items available, then it would be absolutely fine for
        you to sit out the next 3 battles, as the travelling time can be a
        little bit arduous.

]                                                                            [

]____________________________________________________________________________[

Once you've finished the (optional) Fort Condor battle, make a dash over to
Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop and make a fresh save. Also make sure to have a
minimum of 19,400 gil on you. Buy the following:

 NOTE - If you're reluctant to sell any of your weapons (which is completely
        understandable), then you're going to want to save 16,000 gil for the
        materia shop. It may be that you just buy the weapons for the
        characters in your party, then buy the remaining equipment after the
        forthcoming dungeon.

1 x Butterfly Edge   O=O O=O  - Cloud      - 2800 gil
1 x Tiger Fang       O=O O=O  - Tifa       - 2500 gil
1 x Heavy Vulcan     O=O O=O  - Barret     - 2700 gil
1 x Prism Staff      O=O O=O  - Aeris      - 2600 gil
1 x Silver Barrette  O=O O=O  - Red XIII   - 2500 gil
1 x Pinwheel         O=O O=O  - Yuffie     - 2600 gil
1 x Green M-Phone    O=O O=O  - Cait Sith  - 2400 gil
1 x Silver Armlet    O=O O O  - Armour     - 1300 gil
                                   Total - 19,400 gil

If you're selling your weapons head back to the Cosmo Flame and talk to you
team to change your Party and equip every single one of your characters with
their new weapons. Equip your selected team with Silver Armlets and everyone
else with Carbon Bangles. Now arrange your items by 'Type' and get ready to
sell the following:

 NOTES - This is the second and last time that I plan to sell my weapons, we
         shouldn't need to worry about gil too much pretty soon. So far we
         have been collecting Double Growth weapons with 3 Materia slots. We
         are about to collect Double Growth 4-slotted weapons for everyone, so
         I'm selling all of my current Double Growth weapons. Also, MAKE SURE
         to leave a few pieces of armour (Platinum Bangles) to get changed
         into. Don't sell any of you accessories. Sell anything that isn't on
         this list at your peril.

* = Unique Item

 Cloud    - Hardedge        -  750 gil | Aeris   - Striking Staff   -  650 gil
            Force Stealer   - 1100 gil |           Wizard Staff     -  900 gil
                                       |
 Tifa     - Metal Knuckle   -  160 gil | Yuffie  -*4 Point Shuriken -  300 gil
            Mythril Claw    -  375 gil |           Boomerang        -  700 gil
            Grand Glove     -  600 gil |           Wind Slash       - 1000 gil
           *Motor Drive     -  900 gil |
                                       | Cait Sith - Yellow M-Phone -  250 gil
 Barret   - Assault Gun     -  175 gil |             White M-Phone  - 1150 gil
            Atomic Scissors -  700 gil |
            W Machine Gun   - 1000 gil | Other - Mythril Armlet - 175 gil (x2)
                                       |         Carbon Bangle -  400 gil (x1)
 Red XIII -*Mythril Clip    -  400 gil |        *Shinra Beta   -  475 gil (x4)
            Diamond Pin     -  650 gil |         Four Slots    -  650 gil (x1)
            Magic Comb      - 1000 gil |
                                       |                    Total = 16,060 gil

I appreciate that some may have a hard time parting with one of a kind
weapons that can never be obtained again. If that's you then don't fret,
there are other ways of earning gil....

Make your way up to the Materia Shop near the unsealed door and to buy two HP
Plus Materias for 8000 gil each. These things really want Leveling up
straight away, and although it's setting me back 16,000 gil, it's completely
justifiable. I'll be returning to purchase the MP Plus's a little later on
(If you can afford 1 x MP Plus then go right ahead. Equip it on Red XIII).
Here is my set-up going into the cave:

 1) Cloud - Lv 26 (Front)

     Butterfly Edge - All=Fire, All=Time
     Silver Armlet  - All=Restore, Lightning, HP Plus
     Sprint Shoes

 2) Red XIII - Lv 23 (Back)

     Silver Barrette - Elemental=Ifrit, Enemy Skill, Deathblow
     Silver Armlet   - All=Ice, HP Plus, Long Range
     Champion Belt

 3) Barret - Lv 22 (Back)

     Heavy Vulcan  - Revive, Heal, Transform, Enemy Skill
     Silver Armlet - Steal, Manipulate, Sense, HP Plus
     Star Pendant

Before entering I suggest sleeping at the Inn (or just use a tent), and then
saving by Tiger Lily's before heading into the Cave of the Gi!

 NOTE - We're not far off getting our first Level 4 Limit manual, the Cosmo
        Memory for Red XIII! For now, Red and Red alone shall be getting all
        of the kills.

  Make you war down the rope and into the depths of the cave. As you enter
you will notice a few rocks with cracks in them, along with a blue Support
Materia.

There are four rocks in total, exploring the correct one will result in the
secret passageway opening, while the other three will result in a battle.
Figure it out for yourselves; you probably need the gil (I know I do),
besides, battling is fun!

Once you've opened the way to the next area you can explore the remaining
cracks if any, then head through. Make your way left at the fork and WALK
across the oil slick, then head south. If you run through it you'll be flung
into a Spike Trap swiping out roughly a third of everyone's HP. Follow the
path to the previous screen to GRAB THAT MATERIA! the [ADDED EFFECT MATERIA]!
The game just got more advanced. Adhere to the fact that should you miss
Added Effect here then you'll have missed it forever.

] Just like with the Elemental Materia, the Added Effect Materia will have a [
] different effect when adding it onto your weapon as opposed to your        [
] armour. The main difference being that we can now inflict Status changes   [
] to our opponents just by attacking them and defend against their Status    [
] changing attacks! As the game progresses, the possibilities become         [
] seemingly endless.                                                         [
]                                                                            [
] For now though you would do well to equip Added Effect=Poison onto         [
] someone's armour, making sure that it isn't the same person who has the    [
] Star Pendant. Poison isn't exactly the worst Status in the world, so it's  [
] not that crucial to equip it, just bear in mind (again) that Poison is the [
] only Materia in the game that is both an Element and a Status, and is the  [
] only Materia that will work when paired with both Elemental and Added      [
] Effect.                                                                    [

]  NOTE - A Lv 2 Elemental linked with Poison in your armour will also       [
]         protect you from the Poison Status, whereas a Lv 3 Elemental would [
]         make you absorb the poison damage (when poisoned)!                 [
]                                                                            [

] The Contain Materia really is one of the best Materias in the game as it   [
] also inflicts Status changes as well as having Elemental properties. Hades [
] is a Summon that can also be linked to our weapon or armour with Added     [
] Effect to attack/protect with/from some nasty Statuses. Don't forget White [
] Wind and Esuna can cure you from most Statuses.                            [
]                                                                            [
] 91% of all enemies are vulnerable to Slow, 73% are vulnerable to Silence,  [
] 67% are vulnerable to Sleep and 62% are vulnerable to Stop, making the     [
] Time Materia or the Seal Materia the best pieces to attach onto your       [
] weapon for now, at least until you obtain Contain and Hades on Disk 2.     [
]                                                                            [
] Adding Choco/Mog to your weapon with Added Effect will add the 'Stop'      [
] Status to your attacks, which is pointless seeing as you could just        [
] combine Time to your weapon to have a chance of inflicting Stop & Slow.    [
] The level of the Time Materia doesn't matter btw; a level 1 Materia will   [
] still pair all the Statuses attributed to that Materia. You can check the  [
] 'Status' tab in the menus to see for yourself.                             [
]                                                                            [
] Lastly, there is an incredibly useful accessory out there called a Ribbon. [
] This little beauty can protect you from virtually any harmful Status, and  [
] there are a total of 2 to collect. Additionally, they can be morphed from  [
] two different creatures.                                                   [
]                                                                            [
] A comprehensive guide to Statuses can be found in section E.09.            [

Wow that was a long side note. I feel it's more important to learn the game
bit by bit instead of having all the information crammed into one large
section either at the front or the back of a guide which probably won't get
read until one has finished the game and by that point it was too late, one
has already missed out on some crucial information yadayada.....

Love me or hate me, I acknowledge that my explanations can be slightly long-
winded. And with that in mind, let's crack on with the game shall we!

Set up the Added Effect Materia (or don't), then walk back over the oil slick
and to the right. Follow the path north, then down the visible flight of
steps to the south to come to a chest containing the [BLACK M-PHONE], which
is the first 4 slotted double growth weapon.

Then head north, past the flight of steps to the visible chest that contains
an [ETHER]. Now make your way back up the flight of steps and head north to
the next screen.

Here you will see a 'knuckle duster' like branching in the caves. Number them
1 to 5, left to right. 1 basically leads back round to 5, and 3 is a dead
end. Head through 4 first and fight the Stinger that lays waiting for you.
Don't forget to cast Mini on it (Frog Song also works well), and head up the
path to grab an [X-POTION] from the chest.

Now head back down to the knuckle duster, this time going through 2 to fight
the second Stinger. Then head west, then south through the rocks, then bear
right to find a fork in the path leading to the chest that contains a [FAIRY
RING], which is basically an upgraded version of the Star Pendant.

Now make your way north to the third and final Stinger's web, then head
through a hidden split in the rocks to the left to grab a [TURBO ETHER] from
the visible chest.

Time to heal-up and Ether-up, we're about to fight a boss. Change to
Elemental=Choco/Mog on someone's weapon, equip someone with the Fire ring and
replace Transform with Shiva. If anyone has the All=Fire set up then change
it for All=Ice. In fact stay away from Fire altogether. Head to the north
screen and eventually you'll be face to face with:

GRAB THAT MATERIA! After the Boss you will be able to pick up the [GRAVITY
MATERIA]. Note that if you missed it here you *will* have another chance of
obtaining one. A few scenes will play out and eventually you will have to
select your party.

Once you're ready you can now purchase any weapons that you didn't buy
earlier, and make sure to leave with at least 1 MP Plus Materia (you should
already have 3 HP Plus's).

Now make your way out of Cosmo Canyon to have Red XIII re-join the group.
You'll now have the Seraph Comb in your equipment, which is a weapon for Red
XIII.

 NOTE - If you encounter the Bagrisk, try to steal a Vagyrisk Claw from it.
        This can be much easier said than done, as your steal attempt is
        broken into three steals - the first two are for a Soft, the third
        for the Vagyrisk Claw, and the higher the level of the thief, the
        higher the chance of obtaining a Soft on the first two attempts.
