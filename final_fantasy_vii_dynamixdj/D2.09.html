--D2.09 A - Chocobo Breeding Step 2


  There are actually a number of sidequests available for us to do now that
we have Cloud back in our party, although I feel that it is best to do the
next part of the storyline first, seeing as even more optional sidequests
will then open themselves up to us, which we can blast in one hit. For now,
seeing as the Gold Saucer has re-opened we can take part in the next stage of
Chocobo breeding process!

I'm going to assume at this stage that you have mastered one of your Alls and
you have sold it for 1.4 Mil gil, and that you have also captured 2 Great
chocobos. If you haven't mastered an All yet then you are going to need
approximately 250,000 gil.

First head over to the Chocobo Sage's house to buy either 99 Sylkis Greens,
or a minimum of 16. Then head over to the Chocobo Ranch and buy either 99 or
30 Pahsana Greens, then  buy 99 Curiel Greens. You are going to have to feed
your Chocobos somewhere in the region of:

 8 x Sylkis  Greens each to max out Speed
15 x Pahsana Greens each to raise Intelligence
60 x Curiel  Greens each to raise Stamina
25 x Mimett  Greens each to raise Acceleration

 NOTES - The Mimett Greens have a 25% chance of increasing Acceleration by +1,
         and a 75% chance that they'll do nothing. Also, the game won't
         actually state that you have received a boost, so there is no way of
         telling whether or not you have maxed it out!!!

         It doesn't matter if you fully max out Intelligence, Stamina or
         Acceleration at this stage, all that matters is that you max out
         Speed. See section E.14 G for a full rundown on how each Green
         modifies which stat.

Some of the names will vary when you go to feed them, for example Curiel
Greens will appear as Kurie Greens. Even though the Chocobos won't accept
anymore Curiel Greens to improve their Stamina once you've maxed it out,
feeding them Sylkis or Reagan Greens will keep boosting their Stamina
seemingly indefinitely. This won't be necessary (just yet).

Now that you've raised/maxed out your Chocobos stats, it's time to race them
in the Chocobo Races. Also, due to the fact that you've obtained the
Highwind, there are a few new things to do in the Gold Saucer. I will cover
these during the upcoming sidequests section, for now just head straight for
the Chocobo Square, not forgetting to save beforehand. Note that the man who
will convert gil into GP will now sometimes appear standing behind the save
point in the Gold Saucer. He has a 1 in 8 chance of appearing and will
convert a maximum of 10,000 gil into 100 GP (Buy as much GP from him as often
as you can - there are some expensive prizes in the Wonder Square).

When you get to the Chocobo Square, talk to Ester who is standing by the
Jockey room. It is here where we can register our Chocobos for the races,
they'll start off as C class and go up a class every 3 wins that you get.
These don't have to be consecutive, and you don't have to get these Chocobos
higher than class B if you don't want to but I suggest getting them both to
class A for reasons:

1) The GP reward is greater in the higher classes, therefore better preparing
   us for the Battle Square later on.
2) The Enemy Away Materia can only be obtained in the Chocobo Races, and is
   only available as a prize from B class upwards. You are going to want to
   get this out of the way sooner rather than later, again it's completely
   pot luck! You may get 3 of these by the time you've finished breeding, you
   may get none (and yes the effects do stack btw).

 NOTE - If the combined wins for the Chocobos totals 4 or more, then you will
        guarantee a 'special' Chocobo (Green/Blue only).

Whilst racing, you can get away with just keeping it set to Auto for C class,
but you are going to want to set it to manual for B and above. As long as
you've fed them the required Greens as above, you should be fine, just
remember to keep R1+R2 held down to keep replenishing your Stamina. Press
Square several times at the start of the race aswell to max out you running
speed, and watch out for the black Chocobo Teioh, as he can be a real pain at
times to beat (his stats are ALWAYS better than yours).

Once both your Chocobos are class A, you are ready to breed them! Head over
to the Chocobo Ranch and SAVE before entering. Talk to Billy to select Mating
Chocobos, then select GreatM and GreatF to breed. Finally, choose the Carob
Nut, and viola! And brand new (and rather large) baby Chocobo. The breed of
Chocobo will be chosen at random, you'll either get a green or blue Chocobo,
and we'll need to wait until the parents are ready to breed again before we
can obtain the chocobo of opposite gender (I got a male Green).

You could take your new Chocobo out for a spin, but I suggest just heading on
to the next section of the game for now, which is Junon.

 NOTES - A Chocobo that has just mated will not be ready to mate again until
         you have encountered (and won) between 3 to 10 battles. A baby
         Chocobo will not be ready to mate until you have fought (and won)
         between 3 to 19 battles.

       - A newborns Acceleration, Stamina and Intelligence will always be the
         average of its' parents, Cooperation will always be 0, and the 'cap'
         of its Max Sprint speed and Max Running speed will vary depending on
         the type of Nut you use. Refer to QSI Link [Nuts] for more info.

       - If you talk to Chloe she will tell you which of your chocobos has
         the best stats, but only if you've talked to the Chocobo Sage first.
         When you breed you'll have approximately 20% chance of boosting
         Sprint, and a 15% chance of boosting Run. You *don't* have to have
         fed the newborn Greens beforehand, just talk to Chloe and she'll
         tell you if the newborn is the fastest. If the newborn hasn't
         received a boost, perform a soft-reset and try again.

       - If you keep getting the same results, try running in and out the
         barn once before breeding. The try twice, then try three times (to
         keep the RNG advancing)

| the Ghost Ship uses a move called Goannai, which will remove one player    |

| Added Effect with Mystify will result in double damage!                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


  Here was my set-up going into Junon:

 1) Cloud - Lv 48 (Front)

     Crystal Sword   - Elemental=Lightning, Enemy Skill, Morph, Sense Steal
     Wizard Bracelet - All=Restore, MP Turbo=Comet, Ultima, Magic Plus,
     Circlet                                                  HP Plus, MP Plus

 2) Cait Sith - Lv 45 (Back)
                                                                      HP Plus
     Crystal M-Phone - Elemental=Alexander. Added Effect=Contain, Luck Plus,
     Gigas Armlet    - Added Cut=Deathblow, Enemy Skill, Manipulate, Steal,
     Curse Ring                                                     Long Range

 3) Red XIII - Lv 47 (Front)

     Crystal Comb    - Elemental=Ramuh, Revive, Enemy Skill, Steal, Speed Plus
     Wizard Bracelet - All=Time, All=Heal, All=Gravity, HP Plus, MP Plus
     Ribbon

Talk to the Shinra guard at the far end to ride the elevator to upper Junon.
As you make your way through you'll notice that something is missing. Head to
the T-shaped tunnel, as you make your way south you'll be encounter a fleet
of Shinra guards.

Although they might run in the opposite direction, the Slaloms won't. Be sure
to steal some Smoke Bombs from them for the Battle Square later on. When
you're ready head into the service lift at the far end to fight 2 x Submarine
Crew.

At the base of the lift you'll have to fight another 2 Submarine Crew. Once
they've been taken care of, follow the screens down until you reach a save
point (don't worry about the dog blocking the passageway). In the next screen
you'll be able to descend the cargo lift, then follow the path to reach an
underwater pipeline, follow this to reach the reactor.

 NOTES - Before heading into the reactor, you are going to want to morph the
         Ghost Ship into a Guide Book, and these two screens are the only two
         that you'll be able to encounter it at. This area is re-visitable,
         but it's a rather annoyingly long way to travel if you miss it now.
         L4 Suicide will do the trick nicely.

       - Although the underwater tunnel is re-visitable, the reactor itself
         isn't so make sure to pick everything up along the way.

  Once Inside the reactor push the purple switch on the far wall. Plunge even
further down to emerge on a catwalk. Follow it all the way to the west to
come to a save point. Make use of it.

Follow the path to the next screen which looks vaguely like the No 1 reactor
that we blew up in Midgar. Here you will have to fight two lots of Submarine
Crews and 1 lot of Underwater MPs. Make sure to steal a few Shinra Alphas
from them.
                     _
Once you're at the _|  shaped bridge you'll see the Huge Materia. You'd
better be prepared because there's a Boss up ahead. Following the bridge
you'll come to none other than Reno, and he'll have brought a playmate for us!

After the battle has ended you will realise that the Submarine with the Huge
Materia has departed. Head to the left first off to open the chest containing
the [BATTLE TRUMPET], a strong weapon for Cait Sith with 0 growth.

Then head through to the next screen to come to a chest containing Cid's
[SCIMITAR], which is our first Triple Growth weapon of the game! This will
REALLY help for later on, and as previously mentioned is the reason why Cid
will be in my final team.

Before heading into the Sub, BE SURE to grab the final chest on the left
which contains a Key Item, the [LEVIATHAN SCALES]. This is required to put
the flames out at the Da-chao cavern in Wutai.

Now head up the staircase to fight two more sets of Submarine Crew, you'll
then board the Sub. Inside you'll have another set of Submarine Crew to face,
then make use of the save point.

Head into the Operations room to engage in an optional battle with the troops
that you were entertaining Rufus with when you were sneaking onto the Cargo
Ship on Disk 1. I suggest sparing them, but it'll make no difference either
way, unless you wanted to steal another Shinra Alpha from the Captain (you'll
get another chance to steal one later on).

Head up to the control seat, after Cloud has a minor panic attack he'll then
be eager to control the Sub, so sit in the driver's seat and enjoy another
mini-game!

] SIDE NOTE - SUBMARINE MINI GAME                                            [

] This game is fairly straight forward, press triangle to speed up, X to     [
] slow down and Square to fire a torpedo. Watch out for mines, pressing up   [
] will make you descend and pressing down will make you ascend (the way it   [
] should be). You can locate the Red sub using R1, when you see it simply    [
] blast it to hell, you can ignore all of the other yellow submarines. If    [
] you don't manage to destroy it within the 10 minute time limit then the    [
] Huge Materia is lost forever and you should consider re-loading your save. [
]                                                                            [
]  NOTE - If you're not bothered about Huge Materia, then it is worth        [
]         pointing out that if you fail this mission, you can return to      [
]         Junon's pathways leading up to the reactor to find that the path   [
]         that was previously blocked by the barking dog will now be         [
]         unblocked, and when you go through you can steal the Red           [
]         Submarine, although the Huge Materia will not be inside.           [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

Once the Red Submarine has been destroyed Cloud will remark that we should
forget about the Huge Materia at the bottom of the sea for now. We'll come
back to grab it shortly. There is one last thing to do before finishing up
with this section, and that is to head into Junon and ride the cargo lift to
the top (note that this is optional btw).

Head outside to the airport to see a short sequence of one of Junon's
Gelnikas departing with the Huge Materia on board. Looks like it's headed
towards Rocket Town which is our next destination, but not before embarking
on a world of excitement first!

 NOTE - As previously mentioned, If you don't do everything now then I'll
        give you a full re-cap on Disk 3 of everything there is to get.
