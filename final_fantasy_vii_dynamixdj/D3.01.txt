  If you've been following this walkthrough to the letter then there will be
three things for you to do now, however if you've been holding off on a few
side quests until later on then now's the time to do them. I'll very briefly
go over all that there is to do (welcome to Disk 3 btw), for now just resist
the urge to descend down the ladder and instead make your way to the cockpit
of the Highwind.

  LIMITED MOON

Stick Red XIII in your party and make your way up to Bugenhagen's
Observatory. You'll watch a few touching scenes, after which you'll receive
the [LIMITED MOON], which is Red XIII's ultimate weapon. As with Cid's Venus
Gospel, the more current MP Red XIII has, the stronger the Limited Moon will
become; with full MP Red XIII's attack power triples, at 2/3's it doubles,
and at 1/3 it is normal. Anything below 1/3 MP will result in lower than
normal attack power.

 NOTE - You should have now completed your collection of Level 4 Limit Break
        manuals and Ultimate Weapons for each character, if you think you
        are missing any then check sections E.02 and E.13 (respectively) for
        a full rundown.

  NEW THINGS AT BONE VILLAGE

Now that you're on Disk 3, it's time to go digging at Bone Village. You'd
only want to do this if you had missed the Phoenix Materia (as previously
advised), the Bahamut ZERO Materia, and/or the W-Item Materia. If you have
obtained all four Huge Materias, then you will *not* be able to dig up
Bahamut ZERO, even if you had missed out on bahamut and/or Neo Bahamut.

Spot 2 - Good Treasure. Top of the ladders and to the right.
         Phoenix Materia (100%, once only), Nothing (100% afterwards)

Spot 3 - Good Treasure. Just to the right of where the foreman sits.
         Bahamut ZERO (4%, once only), Nothing (100% afterwards)

Spot 4 - Good Treasure. Base of the ladders and to the left of the 'X'.
         W-Item (100%, Once only), Nothing (100% afterwards)

Once you've dug up your first copy of the Phoenix Materia, you can make your
way over to Fort Condor. Head out of the open door of the shack, and make
your way up to grab your second copy of the [PHOENIX MATERIA].

 NOTES - If you are absolutely sure at this stage that you have done every
         single optional quest available then by all mean you can jump down to
         section D3.02 - Decent Into Madness.

  KEY TO SECTOR 5

Back at Bone Village, ask to search for normal treasure and search just above
where they guy at the entrance was digging. This should bag you the Key to
Sector 5, allowing you entrance to a small part of Midgar.

  4TH ENEMY SKILL

Just north west of Bone Village you'll find the Chocobo Sage's house. Head
inside and pet the Green Chocobo to receive the 4th Enemy Skill Materia. Make
sure to buy at least 1 Sylkis Green before you leave.

  PREMIUM HEART

Make your way over to Midgar. Using the key you found at the excavation site
you should be able to run through the previously locked heavy duty door. Make
your way through to the Wall Market and head into the 'ITEM' shop. Examine
the previously broken terminal to receive Tifa's ultimate weapon, the Premium
Heart.

 NOTE - You can talk to the guy who sold you the batteries in the Weapon Shop
        to buy a Sneak Glove for 129,000 gil. It may seem like a lot, but
        believe me it's worth it.

  KALM TRAVELLER

If you haven't obtained a Guidebook by now then head through Junon's
passageways to reach the underwater tunnel leading up to the reactor. Here
you can fight the Ghost Ship to morph one into the Guidebook.

Now head over to Kalm where you can trade the guidebook for the Underwater
Materia. This will remove the time limit whilst fighting Emerald Weapon.

 NOTE - The Earth Harp is obtained by defeating Emerald WEAPON and can be
        exchanged for a Master Magic, Master Command and Master Summon
        Materia. The Desert Rose is obtained by defeating Ruby WEAPON and can
        be exchanged for a Gold Chocobo.

  LUCRECIA'S CAVE

Put Vincent in your party and head over to the Gold Saucer Area. If you have
a Green, Black or Gold Chocobo then you can look for the enclosed waterfall
near Gongaga, if not then you'll have to look for it in your submarine. Enter
the cave and you'll learn about Vincent's past. Leave the cave and re-enter
after you've fought roughly 10 battles to receive the Death Penalty and
Chaos, Vincent's Ultimate Weapon and Lv 4 Limit Break.

  BACK OF ITEM SHOP IN COSMO CANYON

If you haven't already grabbed the Full Cure Materia from the back of the
Item Shop then do so now, it can be found at the top of the far ladders on
the right past the Cosmo Flame. You can also find a pouch containing an
Elixir and a Guard Source here.

  FLASHBACKS AT THE SHINRA MANSION

Head over to Nibelheim and make your way into the Shinra Mansion. Run down
the Hojo's laboratory to view some extra scenes involving Cloud and Zack.

  FINAL HEAVEN

Head into Tifa's house in Nibelheim and play the following notes to obtain
Tifa's Lv 4 Limit Break, Final Heaven:

X, Sq, Tr, L1+Tr, L1+Sq, x, Sq, Tr, L1+X, O, X, Sq, X

  VENUS GOSPEL

Head into Rocket Town and talk to the man standing outside the Item Shop 3
times to receive Cid's ultimate weapon, the Venus Gospel. Don't forget to
grab the Fourth Bracelet and Guard Source from the chests inside the Weapon
Shop and Item Shop.

  TURTLE PARADISE NEWSLETTERS

If you had missed out on the Newsletter at the Shinra HQ the first time
round, and you managed to grab it the second time then now would be the time
to claim your reward - one of each of the Sources and a Megalixir. Head over
to the Turtle Paradise in Wutai.

  DA-CHAO FIRE CAVERN

If you'd obtained the Leviathan Scales whilst you were in the Underwater
Reactor at Junon then you could put out the flames in the Fire Cavern in the
Da-chao Statue. This would bag you the Oritsuru, a weapon for Yuffie, and the
Steal As Well Materia. (I'm going to assume that you've done the Pagoda Side-
quest so I'm not even going to bother listing it.)

  COSTA DEL SOL

If you haven't done so already, head over to the bar and talk to the man on
the left. Buy from him the Long Barrel R which is a weapon for Vincent that
has 255 Attack%, meaning he'll rarely miss (this means Deathblow). Also, If
you've sold one of your Alls you can buy the Villa for 300,000 gil.

  ULTIMATE WEAPON

If you haven't already beaten him then head over to the large crater near
Junon, Ultimate should be waiting for you there. Ram into him to fight him,
after so many turns he'll flee from battle. You can then chase him all over
the map until finally he will rest at Cosmo Canyon, defeat him there to
receive Cloud's ultimate weapon, Ultima Weapon.

  ANCIENT FOREST

You'll need to have either beaten Ultimate Weapon or obtained a Green, Black
or Gold Chocobo to be able to access the forest just east of Cosmo Canyon.
See section D2.10 J - Ancient Forest for the full walkthrough.

  SUNKEN GELNIKA

If you haven't already visited the depths of despair then see section D2.10
M - The Sunken Gelnika for the full walkthrough.

  CHOCOBO BREEDING

 NOTE - If you haven't as yet bred a Gold Chocobo then take the time now to
        make use of the W-Item glitch (unless you find it morally dis-
        pleasing). Duplicate yourself 99 Sylkis Greens, and while you're at
        it duplicate 99 Megalixirs aswell.

Here is the whole Chocobo Breeding process in 10 simple steps:

 1) Catch 2 Great Chocobos from Mideel Area (alongside 1 or 2 Spirals) making
    sure they are opposite sex.

 2) Feed both of them enough Greens to max out their stats, then race them
    both at the Chocobo Square until they are both A Class.

 3) Head over to Bone Village and battle around until you fight the
    Vlakorados, steal 3 x Carob Nuts from them.

 4) Now mate the Great Chocobos using a Carob Nut. This should produce either
    a Blue or Green Chocobo.

 5) When they are ready to mate again, save the game and keep trying until you
    get a Chocobo of opposite gender and breed.

 6) Feed the Green and Blue Chocobos to max out their stats, then race them
    both to A Class. Then mate them using a Carob Nut for a Black Chocobo.

 7) Catch a Wonderful Chocobo from the Icicle Inn Area (alongside 1 or 2
    Jumpings) making sure it's the opposite gender to the Black Chocobo.

 8) Head over to Goblin Island (north of the Chocobo Ranch). Here you can
    fight the Goblin, steal 1 x Zeio Nut from them.

 9) Feed the Black and Wonderful Chocobos to max out their stats, then race
    them both to S Class (if you can).

10) Now breed the Black and Wonderful Chocobo using the Zeio Nut and Hey'
    Presto! A brand new chirping Gold Chocobo!

  MATERIA CAVES

Once you have a Gold Chocobo you can head over to the Materia Cave near Wutai
for the Mime Materia, the Materia Cave near North Corel holds the HP<->MP
Materia, the Materia Cave near Mideel holds the Quadra Magic Materia and the
Round Island in the far north east corner of the map holds the Knights of
Round Materia.

  ENEMY SKILL RE-CAP

Just in case you're missing a few here is a copy and paste from the earlier
sidequest section D2.05 K - Obtaining Every Enemy Skill Available:

 1  MATRA MAGIC    - CUSTOM SWEEPER - Midgar Area (Dirt Area only)
 2  L4 SUICIDE     - MU             - Grasslands Area (near Chocobo Ranch)
 3  CHOCOBUCKLE    - CHOCOBO Lv 16  - Grasslands Area (near Chocobo Ranch)
 4  BETA           - MIDGAR ZOLOM   - Marsh (near Chocobo Ranch)
 5  FLAMETHROWER   - ARK DRAGON     - Mythril Mine (Northern caverns)
 6  WHITE WIND     - ZEMZELETT      - Junon Area
 7  BIG GUARD      - BEACHPLUG      - Gold Saucer Area (Beaches)
 8  AQUALUNG       - HARPY          - Gold Saucer Area (Chocobo Tracks only)
 9  FROG SONG      - TOUCH ME       - Gongaga Forests
10  ????           - JERSEY         - Shinra Mansion (in Nibelheim)
11  DEATH FORCE    - ADAMANTAIMAI   - Wutai Beaches
12  MAGIC HAMMER   - RAZOR WEED     - Wutai Area
13  DEATH SENTENCE - BOUND FAT      - Corral Valley (past Bone Village)
14  GOBLIN PUNCH   - GOBLIN         - Goblin Island

 NOTE - All of the remaining 9 Enemy Skills are available at the Northern
        Crater. If you're thinking 'But there's 24 Enemy Skills', then
        that's because Trine isn't on this list, nor can it be learnt at the
        North Crater.

  GOLD SAUCER

Perhaps the longest of all things optional to complete, here is a re-cap on
everything there is to obtain from the Gold Saucer (always save the best till
last):

 NOTE - If you haven't yet obtained all there is to obtain from the Battle
        Square yet then I suggest waiting until you have obtained the final
        few bits of Materia from the North Crater (i.e. Mega-All).

    Speed Square - Flayer (Optional) - Score 5000+ on the rollercoaster

    Battle Square - Enemy Lure Materia   -    250 BP
                    Pre-emptive Materia  -   1000 BP
                    Speed Plus Materia   -   4000 BP
                    Omnislash            - 32,000 BP
                    W-Summon Materia     - 64,000 BP
                    Final Attack Materia - Bonus Round:

        After you have obtained Omnislash, W-Summon and Ultima Weapon
        (Omnislash must be learnt) you will be invited to fight in an
        optional battle. Defeating this will net you the Final Attack
        Materia. Omnislash must be learned.

    Chocobo Square - Enemy Away Materia
                     Sneak Attack Materia

        Winning 19 races with the same Chocobo will net you the Sprint Shoes,
        Precious Watch, Cat's Bell, Chocobracelet and Counter Attack Materia.
        Also, try to win as many Counter Attacks and Magic Counters as you
        can.

    Wonder Square - Gil Plus Materia - 1000BP
                    EXP Plus Materia - 2000BP

You should now be ready to finish the game! Note that you can descend pretty
far down into the crater before hitting the point of no return, and you can
rest assured that I'll make you aware of that point before you get to it.
