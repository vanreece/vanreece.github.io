] Like before, your prize will be will be 5 x Hi-Potions although it'll tell [
] you that you've received 5 x Potions. This must be completed before        [
] talking to Shera in Rocket Town.                                           [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

Now make your way north to head towards Nibelheim, the home-town of Cloud and
Tifa. As you enter you will notice something isn't quite right...

Go into the house on the right and head up the stairs. In the attic you'll
find two weird looking things, one of them will give you a [LUCK SOURCE] if
you talk to it.

Now head into the next house along, Tifa's house and go into the kitchen.
Another, larger black blob at the back here will give you a [TURBO ETHER]. He
has the number 11 tattooed on him. (Hang on a minute, didn't a guy in Midgar
Sector 7 have a tattoo on him? hmmm...)

Now head up the stairs and in the northern bedroom to grab the [PLATINUM
FIST] from number '4'. You can head into Tifa's bedroom if you like and play
her piano again, aswell as reading an incredibly interesting note left on her
writing desk.

The next house along is Cloud's old house, there's nothing much here other
than a bit of weird banter, so head into the next house on the other side of
the street to grab an [ELIXIR] from number '12'. You can also buy a few items
from here.

Now head into the inn and grab a [LUCK SOURCE] from number '6'. You can rest
here for 100 gil if you like, I suggest doing so as the next area can get
rather tricky.

Make your way north to the Shinra Mansion. If you were to talk to one of the
blobs outside you'll learn that Sephiroth is inside. I suppose we'd better
take a look inside then. Save first.

| The Jersey will only use ???? if their left counter is down, which will be |
| as soon as the battle begins. When their left counter is down they will    |

] For what it's worth I'm not going to help you out..... just yet. See if    [
] you can figure it out yourself. If you think you've cracked it then try to [
] open the safe to fight the Boss, Lost Number. Otherwise skip down to just  [
] below the Boss section where I shall reveal the combination and how you    [
] were to have figured it out. Just remember that whilst inputting the       [
] numbers you cannot go past the correct digit, otherwise you'll have to     [
] start over.                                                                [

O.K., so you've either figured out the puzzle on your own in which case you
can skip out the next paragraph, or you've given up (or you're just lazy) and
you want to know the combination the easy way. Here's how to solve it:

 Dial 1 - Right 36 - 'The lid of the box with the most oxygen.' This was the
                     treasure chest we opened on the western side of the 2nd
                     Floor.

 Dial 2 -  Left 10 - 'Behind the ivory's short of tea and ray.' This was
                     written on the floor behind the piano on the 1st Floor
                     on the western side.

  NOTE - This is left to the number 10 (so left 26 clicks).

 Dial 3 - Right 59 - 'The creek in the floor board near the chair on the
                     second floor... Then to the left five steps, up nine
                     steps, left two steps and up six steps.' This is the one
                     I remember struggling with. In the eastern room on the
                     2nd floor, search the hallway in line with the chest.

 Dial 4 - Right 97 - 'The fourth has been written in invisible ink....' When
                     selecting which clue you'd like to read you can bring
                     the finger cursor down to the fourth line which will
                     give the answer away in invisible ink.

|/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\|
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now that you have opened the safe and defeated Lost Number, set your Materia
back to the way it was and GRAB THAT MATERIA! the [ODIN MATERIA], and also
the 'Key to the Basement' from the safe itself. If you've unlocked all of Red
XIII's Limit Breaks then you can go ahead and teach him Cosmo Memory (by
selecting it from the item menu), unlocking the 'A Universe Of Pain' Trophy.

 NOTE - Odin can be paired with Added Effect for the 'Death' Status.

Now head down the spiral staircase on the eastern 2nd floor wing, and into
the basement. Before reaching the lab, go through the now open door leading
to a coffin. inspect the coffin to talk to the man residing inside about
Sephiroth.

After he has finished, inspect the coffin one more to name [VINCENT]. When
you get the dialogue box "let me sleep" it's time to leave. Congratulations,
you've now acquired Vincent! He'll join your party as you leave the basement
(unlocking the Won't You be My Valentine? Trophy). Before doing that however,
head into the laboratory to the east for an encounter with someone.....
(There's that name again, Professor Gast..)

After he has finished confusing Cloud talking about Jenova and Reunion, he'll
leave behind the [DESTRUCT MATERIA]. Before making your way out you can
examine various reports in the main office, and you can also examine the two
test tubes in the lower right corner of the lab.

That's just about all there is to do here for now. Head out of the Shinra
Mansion (grabbing ???? from the Jersey on the 2nd floor if you haven't
already), rest up at the inn and head out of Nibelheim through the northern
exit to the World Map. Follow the mountain path north until you reach Mt.
Nibel.

--Items - Rune Blade, Plus Barrette, Powersoul, Elixir, Elemental Materia,
          Sniper CR, All Materia, Counter Attack Materia
--Boss  - Materia Keeper Lv 38 (Jem Ring)


  This is my set up going into Mt. Nibel:

 1) Cloud - Lv 30 (Back)

     Butterfly Edge - All=Fire, Heal, Steal
     Silver Armlet  - All=Restore, Long Range, HP Plus
     Sprint Shoes

 2) Vincent - Lv 29 (Back)

     Peacemaker    - Elemental=Choco/Mog, Enemy Skill, Sense
     Silver Armlet - Manipulate, Deathblow, HP Plus, MP Plus
     Champion Belt

 3) Yuffie - Lv 25 (Back)

     Pinwheel      - Added Effect=Time, Revive, Enemy Skill
     Silver Armlet - All=Ice, Steal, HP Plus
     Fire Ring

Traverse through the winding paths of Mt. Nibel until you come to a path
leading up the mountain. Having the Finger Indicator enabled with SELECT
helps here. At the top of the mountain you'll find a chest containing the
[RUNE BLADE].

Make you way back round the mountain side and back down onto the main path.
Head towards the bridge on the left and just before you reach it you'll
notice a path that bears off to the north. Make your way up the second
mountain to obtain the [PLUS BARRETTE]. These paths can be slightly tricky to
navigate, so once you do finally make your way back down to the main path
head up and over the bridge.

 NOTE - The soundtrack here, 'Under The Rotting Pizza' is one of my fav in
        the game. For a midi soundtrack that was made in the 90's, you can't
        help but appreciate the suspense and the tension that the track
        holds, not to mention the reverb of the bass and the crisp-ness of
        the drums (I have made music in the past so I can appreciate good
        production value. In fact, making this walkthrough isn't too dis-
        similar from making a track).

You'll eventually come to a large cavern with 5 pipes. Only number 2 and
number 4 lead to treasure, the other three lead to nowhere special. Head down
number 2 first to land on a rock containing the [POWERSOUL]. We'll circle
back round for the remaining treasure a little later on.

 NOTE - The Powersoul is a weapon for Tifa that doubles in power if she is
        either in critical HP, and quadruples if she is inflicted with Death
        Sentence (effects stack for 8x power). It is also double growth.

I never fight the Boss here straight away for some reason, although feel free
to do so if you wish. Save the game regardless and then head through the
southern screen. Drop down to the path below and head though the opening on
the right. Had you ventured to see what was on the left you would have found
the place where Sephiroth & co. had landed after the bridge had collapsed
during the flashback.

In this screen you can make your way round to the top of the screen, and then
double back through the not-so-obvious path to the opening on the left.
Follow the path south to emerge at a chest containing an [ELIXIR].

Make your way back through to progress into the next screen. It seems that
the 'knowledge of the Ancients that is contained within the Materia' (quote)
has taken form. Just to the left of the life stream fountain is (breath in)
GRAB THAT MATERIA! the [ELEMENTAL MATERIA]! (If you missed it at the Shinra
HQ and you didn't 'jam on the piano' during the flashback then this will be
the only place to obtain the Elemental Materia. This area is revisit-able.)

The next screen along takes you to a mini maze of sorts, follow your
instincts to the chest containing the [SNIPER CR], a weapon for Vincent that
has the max stat (255) for his attack%. Meaning, he'll never miss a shot with
this weapon equipped! Try pairing it with Deathblow for the ultimate combo
(at this stage). Note that Vincent *may* miss a shot with Deathblow (although
it's rare), it's only his normal attacks that are impossible to miss.

The next screen leads to another winding path. There's nothing to find on the
right, so head west to eventually arrive at the reactor. You can take a look
around inside if you like, but there's nothing to obtain. When you're ready,
head past the reactor to return to the cavern with 5 shoots, a save point and
the Materia Keeper!

 NOTE - If you haven't managed to steal 3 Gold Armlets yet then don't worry,
        you'll be able to buy them for 2000 gil each in the next town along.

If you're planning on doing the Fort Condor battles then I suggest that you
*make sure* to interact with the lower ladder to release its latch (do it
anyway even if you aren't doing the FC battles). Now head up the other ladder
to return to the shoots, this time sliding down No. 4. After picking up the
[ALL MATERIA], head over to the save point and take a leak. No I mean, errr,
save your game, obviously. It's time to come face to face with............

take a deep breath as you run into the jaws of the Materia Keeper!

Before continuing make sure to GRAB THAT MATERIA! the [COUNTER ATTACK
MATERIA] that the Materia Loser drops behind. Now follow the new path to
eventually emerge out onto the World Map. Counter Attack can also be won at
the Chocobo Races.

 NOTE - (sigh) The Counter Attack Materia. It may sound pleasing at first,
        the idea of having a 30% chance to Counter each time the bearer is
        hit. That is unless of course your trying to steal an item from your
        enemy. Or you are trying to fill your Limits up, or if you are
        trying to learn an Enemy Skill and you keep accidentally killing your
        opponent. only equip it if you are 100% sure that you actually want
        it.
