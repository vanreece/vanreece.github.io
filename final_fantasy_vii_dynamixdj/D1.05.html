  After watching a scene in which an executive named Reeve was disagreeing
with some of President Shinra's' decisions, you'll finally awaken in the
sewers. This is your last chance to Equip everyone if you haven't already.
Before you talk to your buddies, go into the Item menu and give everyone a
Hyper. Why? (I smell a Side note coming on...)

] their 2-1 Limit by reaching their kill threshold and they are ready to     [
] start working on their 2-2 Limit, of course! Fury and Sadness are the only [

%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%

After this battle I unlocked Cross-Slash, Cloud's 1-2 Limit! You shouldn't be
too far off yourself now. When you do unlock it remember to give Cloud a
Tranquilizer to clear his Fury Status.

We're definitely going to want to start getting some Aeris kills now, so heal
up using the 'All Trick' with Cloud if you need to then give Aeris the
All=Ice combo. Just note that when all players are Fury'd the battle system
get can get a little messy. You should be able to absolutely storm through to
their 1-2 in no time though, so Fury shouldn't be too much of a hindrance.

Grab the [POTION] on the left if you haven't already. I unlocked Tifa's
Somersault in the next battle, when you achieve Tifa's 1-2 remember to give
the Cover Materia to Aeris.

Traverse through the mucky sewers until you reach the [STEAL MATERIA]. Guess
what? The battle system just got more interesting. Equip this onto Cloud and
have him steal on every turn, just let the girls get the kills (Aeris first,
always Aeris first, Tifa can weaken). Try to steal a few Hypers and
Tranquilizers before leaving the sewers if you can.

 NOTE - If you steal an item from an enemy then that enemy will no longer
        drop an item. Also, the character that is the highest level has the
        best chance of stealing, which is why I suggest making Cloud your
        main thief.

Drop down to the next screen then make your way up the ladders and out into
the Train Graveyard. Save your game here.

Before continuing change from an All=Ice combo to an All=Fire combo, Aeris
can take out the Ghosts one hit that way. If you happen to come across the
Eligor make sure to steal a Striking Staff from it. Aeris won't acquire a
better weapon for quite some time.

Head through the train cart by the save point and inspect the barrel on the
left for a [HI-POTION].

Head back the way you came then up the ladders to the right of the save point
for another [HI-POTION]. Keep heading north until you find another barrel
containing an [ECHO SCREEN].

Now head under the bridge and into the middle cart for a [POTION]. Follow the
path through until you've traversed the set of train carts to the right,
eventually coming to a [POTION] just before the next screen.

In the next screen you'll see a flashing item to the left, make your way
round to it for a [POTION], then head over to the western barrel for an
[ETHER].

 NOTE - In the menus, try arranging your items by 'Type' for the best
        arrangement.

Now make your way to the east. The pre-rendered backgrounds should make it
fairly obvious what to do here, I'll walk you through it just in case. Hop
into the first train, once it has finished moving hop back into it to move it
back into its original position. Now make your way into the newly accessible
train, and finally head up the ladders for the [HI-POTION].

Before heading through to the next screen (it should start looking familiar
now), consider battling around for the Eligor if you haven't already obtained
the Striking Staff. This would also be a good time also to try to work on
Aeris's 80 kills. Don't worry too much about it though, we've a long
adventurous journey ahead of us! Also, stocking up on a few Graviballs from
the Deenglow can help out for certain bosses (in fact, if you want to obtain
a powerful skill a little later on then I suggest walking away with at least
2). Lastly, if you want to obtain one of everything then I suggest walking
away with at least one Ghost Hand (obtained from the Ghost). You'll get one
more chance to obtain a Ghost Hand later on at the Battle Square (prior to
reaching Rocket Town).

 NOTE - When you do head back through to Sector 7 (the next screen), Aeris
        will leave your party for a while. Any Materia she may be carrying at
        the time will be deposited back into your stock, so you don't need to
        worry about that, however you do want to replace her Mythril Armlet
        with something less worthy; you'll need the Mythril Armlet for Barret.

--Boss - Turks: Reno Lv 17


  After some short events have played out, you'll regain control of Cloud.
Talk to the guy with grey hair to stock up on a few Hypers and Tranquilizers
if you wish, then save.

We won't be able to revisit the slums to the left so we have no choice but to
ascend the support tower. Along the way you'll fight Aero Combatants, they
have a decent amount of HP. You can also talk to the other Avalanche members
as you climb the structure.

Once at the top, you'll have a brief opportunity to equip your characters. I
suggest you make use of it. After equipping Barret with the Mythril Armlet,
give him a Hyper and then set up you Materia something like this:

 Cloud  - Lv 14 - All=Restore, Fire, Steal
 Barret - Lv 12 - Ice, Lightning, Cover
 Tifa   - Lv 13 - Ice, Restore, Lightning

Use the 'All Trick' to heal up Cloud and Tifa (In case you've forgotten how
to do this, go into 'Magic' in the menus then go to use Cloud's Cure, and
before selecting a party member press R1 to select everybody simultaneously).
Note that the following boss is strong against Lighting so we won't be using
it, I've only equipped it for the AP.

After the fight we'll have to talk to Tifa, then after an animated scene
followed by an amount of dialogue, we'll eventually regain control of Cloud
again (I'd be worried if we didn't).

We'll grab the yellow Materia you saw in the previous screen a little later
on. Head south for now, and after a moment where Cloud remembers something
that Sephiroth once said, Tifa & Barret will join you. Equip an All=Ice
combo. If you really want to grab that command Materia now, by all means do
so, otherwise make your way back to Sector 5 Slums.

--Items   - Turbo Ether, Ether, Sense Materia
--Extra   - Batteries x 3


  If you had left that 5 gil in the chest from before then you can revisit
the boys room to receive a [TURBO ETHER]. Examine the Turtle Paradise poster
now if you didn't previously. Then head over To Aeris's house, having a quick
save along the way.

When you enter (Oh God, the music), you'll have to listen to Elmyra's story,
then eventually you can control Cloud. Head upstairs and talk to Barret (Best
Bromance - choose option 1, "I don't know"). You can rest here for free if
you like, just run over to the bed you slept in before. Then head outside and
Tifa will suggest heading over to the Wall Market.

If you encounter the Vice be sure to steal from them. If you didn't pick it
up earlier, now is the time to pick up the [SENSE MATERIA] from the park.
Note that once you have sensed an enemy during a battle you won't need to
sense it a second time. Just make sure that the Status Bar is open (Select)
and you'll be able to see an enemies remaining HP.

When you return to Wall Market you'll notice that peoples disposition towards
you will have changed. The stunt you played before has earned you a bit of a
reputation! The Materia Shop is now open, but unless you're wanting to buy
another Cover Materia then there's really nothing worth going in there for.
My advice is to buy a 2nd piece, as the effects stack against each other, but
it's up to you!

Head up to the Weapon Shop again and this time talk to the guy on the left.
He'll ask you if you want to buy some batteries - buy them! You won't be able
to progress otherwise.

As you head north towards Don's mansion you will be beckoned by a bunch of
kids. If you didn't pick up the Phoenix Down from earlier because Cloud was
chosen by the Don then you can go and grab it now. Head into the mansion, up
the stairs and into the room on the right. If you were then to head down the
long flight of stairs once more, you could engage in some optional dialogue.
Head to the eastern dead-end that the kids were mentioning when you're ready.

After hearing Barret's famous Shiny Golden Wire speech, you'll be able to
climb this wire (which wasn't there before btw). When you get to the top make
your way over to the lit area on the bottom right. Insert the battery to make
the propeller blade start to spin, once it has stopped you can climb up it.
Place the second battery at the top also.

This next bit can be a little bit tricky, keep climbing until you come to a
swinging rod. You have to time it so that you push the action button at the
exact moment the rod touches the other object of similar colour to the left
(or just slightly before). Once across, you can make your way up to the next
screen.

Before heading all the way up here, follow the rope back down to the third
battery slot to receive an [ETHER]. Head back down to the previous screen to
do the whole rod swinging thing again, once you've completely ascended you'll
finally arrive at the Shinra HQ!
