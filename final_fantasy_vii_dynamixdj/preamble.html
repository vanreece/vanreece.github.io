 NOTE - If you are playing on the Steam or PS4 version, then the game will be
        comprised of 'sections' as opposed to 'disks'. For this guide I will
        be referring each section as a disk ('cus I'm old-skool).

If you are viewing this guide on a mobile, remember to switch to desktop
version to view this guide in its correct format. Alternatively, click 'view

  Final Fantasy VII is now approaching two decades old. 'Why am I investing
hundreds of hours into a walkthrough for a game that is nearly 20 years old',
I find myself asking, and the answer is... I don't entirely know. All I know
is that I've never felt for a game the way I have felt for Final Fantasy VII.
In fact, be it game, book, film, TV series; nothing has ever compelled or
intrigued, scratch that, nothing has ever left me thinking "how in the flying
funk did they ever come up with this???" Welcome to the impossibly brilliant,
expertly paced, masterfully executed nostalgic global phenomenon that is FF7.

  'And given the fact that the game is getting a HD upscaled version
   brought out to the PS4 *with trophies* this winter (2015), I
   thought to myself "hey, why not scratch that age old itch and write
   the most comprehensive, detailed walkthrough I am capable of
   writing?" Why not indeed....'

I may be over selling the game a little; for those who are completely new to
the game I'm not going to beat around the bush. The graphics are outdated;
the battle system is (by today's standards) way too easy; and the Japanese to
English translation is some-what flawed. 'So why should I invest time into
the game then', you may be asking? Because, if one was to make a 'Games to
play before you die list', then FF7 would have to be at the top of every
list. "BUT WHY??" I hear you screaming. Because...    never    before or
since has a story-plot twist literally blown my mind to the point where even
now, having played the game for around the 20th time, I am still learning
elements of the story that are completely new to me; I am still marvelling at
sub-contextual dialogue that I'd previously missed and/or not fully
understood before; and I am still finding more of the hundreds upon hundreds
of hidden secrets that the game harvests. Seasoned player or not, one will
still be able to appreciate FF7 for what it naturally is - a humorous and
sometimes promiscuous but fascinatingly deep and compelling, well-paced
story; an immensely huge and rewarding collectible system; a diverse and
balanced battle system with engrossing tactics and strategies; beautifully
pre-rendered background graphics that give the game a certain 'magical' feel;
and the most awesome midi soundtrack that you will most likely ever hear in a
game! And remember folks - be like Jesus. Save often!

  'Whether you're playing the game for the first time ever, you've
   played it a few times as a kid but didn't really get into it
   properly, or you're a FF7 veteran and (like me) you're overjoyed at
   the prospect of having actual Playstation trophies for the game, I
   can guarantee this: Using this guide you *will* experience the game
   to its absolute fullest, and regardless of how much you think you
   know about the game, you *will* learn something that you hadn't
   previously. This has been my endeavour.'

        If you find this walkthrough to be helpful, please remember to

Dear reader: During the development of this guide, I came about some great
             tools that have been developed solely for the purpose of
             understanding Final Fantasy VII's scripting and mechanics. So,
             the majority of the 'factual' data contained within this guide
             can be trusted, as it has been obtained *from source*.

             Of course, I didn't come across these tools until quite soon
             into the guide, and there may still be a few grey-areas that
             I've missed. If you notice something that doesn't quite add-up
             to your own knowledge and understanding of the game, the please
             feel free to get in touch with me and I would be more than happy
             to look into the game's coding - DynamixDJ@writeme.com

             Acknowledgements for the tools that I have been using can be
             found in section J - Special Thanks.

The PS4 release and the Steam release have varying Trophy/Achievement lists.

The Steam version has an Achievement list that really doesn't require a
'specialised' guide that differs from any other guide out there, as every
single Achievement is straight forward and easy enough to figure out WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF MATERIA OVERLORD! I have made the relevant notifications for
that achievement throughout the guide.

The PS4 version on the other hand has 'specific' requirements, and without a
guide you could find yourself re-playing the game to clean up on missed
Trophies.

This guide will walk you through the PS4 version's Trophy list, assuring that
you won't miss a single one!

                         then instead of receiving an error message telling
                         you that your inventory is full, the Materia will be
                         permanently removed from the field, without being
                         added to your inventory.

                         Materia. If you fail to obtain one of these, then
                         you can dig Bahamut ZERO up from Bone Village, but
                         *ONLY* if you failed one of the Huge Materia
                         missions (it doesn't matter which one).
                         If you have obtained the Huge Blue Materia, then

                         (200), then instead of receiving an error message
                         telling you that your inventory is full, the Materia
                         will be permanently removed from the field, without

                         game regardless of whether or not you have completed

                         Pandora's Box (because it's MP is too low) then re-
                         load your save.
                         You have been warned!

Welcome to the wonderful and alluring world that is Final Fantasy VII, I hope
you thoroughly enjoy it! Before scrolling down to the walkthrough itself, I
suggest spending a few brief moments to familiarise yourself with the way in
which I've designed my guide:-

Every area that you enter you will be faced with a brief run-down of the
enemies you will encounter, as follows:

+---------------------------#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
|                           >  ENEMIES:                          **********  <
|      NOTE ON ENEMIES:     >           [           ENEMY NAME] [TOXIC FROG] <
|                           >                                    **********  <
| Here you can find a brief > ------Lv: [Enemies Current Level] [--------26] <
| description of the        > ------HP: [-------Enemies Max HP] [-------500] <
| enemies that you will be  > ------MP: [-------Enemies Max MP] [-------100] <
| facing. Note that if you  > -----EXP: [----Experience Gained] [-------420] <
| see stars above an        > ------AP: [Ability Points Gained] [--------30] <
| enemies name as shown in  > -----GIL: [-----------Gil Gained] [-------260] <
| the example then it means > ---STEAL: [---Item You Can Steal] [---Impaler] <
| an Enemy Skill can be     > ---MORPH: [---Item You Can Morph] [----Remedy] <
| learned from that enemy.  > ----DROP: [-Item That Is Dropped] [---Impaler] <
| Also, you'll need the     > --ABSORB: [---Elemental Strength] [-------PSN] <
| Steal Materia to be able  > -NULLIFY: [---Elemental Strength] [----------] <
| to steal, and you'll need > ---HALVE: [---Elemental Strength] [----------] <
| the Morph Materia to be   > --DOUBLE: [---Elemental Weakness] [-------ICE] <
| able to morph.            > -E-SKILL: [--Enemy Skill Learned] [-FROG SONG] <
+---------------------------#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

I have abbreviated each Element as follows:

Fire      = FRE  |  Gravity     = GRV
Ice       = ICE  |  Water       = WTR
Lightning = LHT  |  Wind        = WND
Earth     = ERT  |  Holy        = HLY
Poison    = PSN  |  Restorative = RES

If you are unfamiliar with the Restorative Element then please visit section
E.05 for more details on obscure Elements, or use QSI Link [Restorative].

Quick Searching - Don't forget to make use of Control + F!!! If you see a
                  comment that suggests for you to visit section E.01 (for
                  example), when copying E.01 into the search bar be sure to
                  manually add the braces {} around E.01 yourself. This way
                  you'll jump straight to the desired section, as opposed to
                  filtering through all the references to section E.01 that
                  are mentioned throughout the walkthrough. Note that the
                  braces are the keys above [], not the brackets above 9 & 0.
______________________________________________________________________________

!!!!!!!!!! I have now added what I call a 'Quick-Search Index Link' system (or
!        ! QSI Link). You can now type something into the search field such as
!  QUICK ! Omnislash, Confusion, or Zeio Nut (for example), then surround the
! SEARCH ! criteria  with braces {} (not the () brackets). You will then jump
!  INDEX ! directly to that relevant section within the guide! Whenever you
!  LINKS ! see 'QSI [Index]' you'll know that you are looking at a 'Quick-
!        ! Search Index Link' reference. Try typing the word Index into the
!!!!!!!!!! search field surrounded by {} to jump straight to the Index.

  been reversed from their original settings.

    TIPS:

 - Make the most of the quick-search feature! This walkthrough is immensely
   huge, and utilising Control + F will save you a lot of time and headaches.
   I have tentatively set-up a feature that allows for effective use of quick-
   searching, see the index for more info.

 - Save often. There is no auto-save feature, so forgetting to make use of a
   save point could be costly. I also recommend making multiple save files.

 - Your kills count towards Leveling up your Limit Breaks! Try to bear that
   in mind when choosing which player to be the main attacker.

 - Press Select whilst in the field to bring up the helpful arrow indicators.

 - Arranging your Items by 'Type' in the Item Menu is always a good idea.

 - You can change the speed of the battle in the 'Config' menu. You can also
   fiddle with the colour of the window, just don't touch the button config.

 - When swapping your characters over, be sure to also swap their current
   Armour and Accessory over too.

 - You can use the 'Exchange' tab in the Materia menu to arrange your Materia
   around with characters that aren't currently in your party.

 - Whilst in the PHS menu you can press confirm twice on a character to see
   what current equipment they have on them, without having to put them in
   your party first.

These tips are just scratching the surface, I've included within the
walkthrough all of the useful things that you will need to know about the
game.

! I would just like to say now that a huge shout out goes to Absolute Steve  !

! his excellent Training/Random Encounter FAQ. NFITC1 has been a great help  !
! by consistently answering many of my questions regarding the inner         !
! mechanics of the game, along with his "Proud Clod" tool; although          !
! TFergusson probably deserves the most amount of praise for his Mechanic    !

! Kazushige Nojima, Nobuo Uematsu and the rest of the Development Team.      !
! Although the final product was rather hurried and riddled with             !
