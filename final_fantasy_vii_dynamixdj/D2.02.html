  As mentioned, you only have 544 steps before you pass out, which equates to
roughly 2 and a half minutes of movement. When you do pass out, you'll awaken
in a shack at the base of Gaea's Cliff. You don't have to back track for the
missing items if you don't want to, but obviously I would advise grabbing
everything you possibly can.

 NOTE - If you mess up the snowboarding challenge and you'd rather try again
        to take the advised path (left, left), then you can exit to the World
        Map either from the entrance, or even more comically from the area
        east of the entrance. Head into the cavern on the right to find a
        shoot that will project Cloud out into the World Map. Here you can
        head back to Icicle Inn to try the snowboarding game again.

This map should explain where to go far better than I could using just
paragraphs:

                    To World Map and Icicle Inn


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                             If you'd taken the :-

    Left + Right path you would have landed at the entrance. Head north to
    continue on from the forest.

    Right + Left path you would have landed at the Lone Tree. Head south,
    then west to continue on from the forests.

    Left + Left path (as advised) you would have landed in the forest.

    Right + Right path you would have landed east of the entrance. Make your
    way through the south screen to arrive at the entrance then continue
    north to come to the forest.

Take as much time as you need to study this map, you aren't on a time limit
or anything. You can also bring up the Glacier Map that you stole by using
Square. Your aim is to make it to area 9 without passing out as it's
extremely difficult to pick up the final item at 11 (Elixir) in one trip.

 NOTE - Some screens will have more exits than are marked on this map. Most
        of them will lead back to the same routes. For example, when you get
        to 11, there will be three northern exits all of which will lead back
        to the same route in the screen north of 11 with the Moai face on it.
        Don't be put off by the orientation of the through-screens, either.

 1.) At the very north of the screen in the forests, you'll be able to pick up
     (A), the [MIND SOURCE]. Now head east two screens to 2.

 2.) To the north east of the screen you'll be able to pick up (B), the
     [POTION]. By not pressing confirm a second time, you can add one to your
     inventory whilst retaining the Potion's 'source'. Meaning, it'll still
     be there when you run back. Now head north west to 3.

 3.) You'll have to step on the ice blocks in a certain sequence here to be
     able to get to the other side. The same goes for on the way back. In the
     cave ahead you'll be able to find (C), the [SAFETY BIT] (be sure to get
     this).

 4.) Picking a second 'infinite' potion as you return through section 3, make
     your way east two screens to the Lone Tree.

 5.) Heading east, make your way 4 screens up to the far eastern mountainside
     'split'.

 6.) Now head through the far eastern exit, this is a one way path that can
     only be travelled on from screen 5. Along the path on the second screen
     to the right, you'll just about to be able to make out (D), the [ADDED
     CUT MATERIA] in the snow. GRAB THAT AWESOME MATERIA! This whole area is
     re-visit able.

  NOTE - Added Cut can be paired with Deathblow for devastating effect. In
         fact, it's the only reason I've taken Vincent along with me, if
         you've followed the exact set-up that I've had (with the Sniper CR)
         then replace HP Absorb with Added Cut, Now! Also, you could pair it
         with Steal instead if you wished to turn it into 'Mug'.

 7.) You should now emerge at the hot springs. MAKE SURE to examine the left
     side of it to 'touch it' as you won't be able to grab the Alexander
     Materia otherwise. Then make your way 3 screens to the north to come to
     the snow fields.

 8.) Every second or so press confirm to lay down a marker. When the wind
     throws you off direction, stop moving. Use the markers that you have
     placed to pick up your orientation. Firstly, head north to find and
     igloo type cavern containing (E) the [ALL MATERIA] (it's not like we
     need anymore of these things).

 9.) Now head out of the igloo and head east. After you've travelled through
     4 screens you'll find yourself on more mountain side paths. Head into
     the eastern cavern and replace Counter Attack with Steal. As long as you
     touched the hot springs earlier, then you can fight the Snow here, and
     even though the music suggests a boss battle it's actually just the same
     Snow as listed above. Make sure to steal a Circlet from her. Once she
     has been defeated she'll leave behind (F), the [ALEXANDER MATERIA].
     Although you can return to this area later on in the game, GRAB THAT
     MATERIA! now anyway to save yourselves the hassle (naturally).

  NOTE - We now have our first and only piece of Holy Materia! Use it wisely.

 10.) As long as you've managed to grab the Alexander Materia without passing
      out then you'll have succeeded in grabbing as much as I intended for
      you to grab. Don't even attempt to make your way over to the remaining
      can make use of there, however. I suggest at this point either making
      your way back to the Snow Fields and then north to find Holzoff's
      cabin, or just running around until you pass out, you'll then awaken in
      his cabin.

      Once at the cabin, you'll have to listen to Holzoff's story to
      continue. After spending the night there, head outside to hear Barret
      embarrass himself, then your teammates will join you. If you're really
      not that bothered by the Elixir nor the exploit, then you can continue
      down to section D2.03, otherwise head south back to the Snow Fields.
      When you head back out you'll have a fresh 544 steps to play with.

 11.) From the Snow Fields head all the way to the west 3 screens to arrive at
      more cliff sides. Note the face in the northern cliff is a Moai face
      that is actually a recurring easter egg found throughout the FF series.
      They serve no purpose, and can usually be found in remote locations. The
      only other Moai face found in VII is during the Chocobo Races (Ok, not
      so remote. Try looking on the bottom of the ocean or on the moon, as in
      previous FF's).

      Now make your way west 3 screens to arrive at a cavern that can be
      entered from both sides. the final item here, the [ELIXIR] (G) can be
      duplicated as many times as you please, so long as you don't pick up
      the source (exactly like the Potion we saw earlier, but unfortunately
      not the Mind Source). Press confirm once to have the message 'Received
      Elixir' appear, but DON'T press confirm a second time. Instead, run out
      of the cavern and back in again. The Elixir will still be there, and
      you'll have added one to your count. As long as you don't accidentally
      pick up the source of the eternal Elixir, then you'll be able to keep
      coming to this spot as many times as you like. This also applies to the
      Steam/PS4 versions.

  NOTE - If you're interested in item duplication, then just remember there's
         a far, far quicker way of doing so at the end of Disk 2 once you've
         obtained the W-Item Materia. Probably the oldest trick in the
         walkthrough-book, the W-Item trick will duplicate any item in less
         than a second so long as it can be used in battle. Also note that
         there are other ways of duplicating rare items such as the Alexander
         Materia, but they are so complicated and difficult to perform that
         I'm not going to even bother to go into it. For more info see
         section E.18.

That just about wraps up everything there is to do within the Great Glacier,
so head over to the base of Gaea's Cliff and into Holzoff's Cabin once more.
Alternatively, you can just run around until you pass out.
