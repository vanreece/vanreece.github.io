--Items - Titan Materia
--Boss  - Turks: Reno Lv 22 (Fairy Tale) + Rude Lv 23


  You will see Gongaga directly in front of you as you cross the southern
river from the Gold Saucer Desert. It is a round village surrounded by forest
(2nd chance to recruit Yuffie). Save and set up your Materia and accessories
to defend against Fire, as soon as you enter you'll have to fight:

* This is a fairly easy fight even if | -------Lv: | 23------ | 22-------- | *
* you are battling two Turks at once  | -------HP: | 2000---- | 2000------ | *
* this time. Start the battle as you  | -------MP: | 135----- | 80-------- | *
* would any Boss Battle; by using Big | ------EXP: | 720----- | 660------- | *
* Guard. They use a fair amount of    | -------AP: | 70------ | 60-------- | *
* fire based attacks so a Fire Ring   | ------GIL: | 2000---- | 1500------ | *
* wouldn't go amiss, also having the  | -----DROP: | X-Potion | Fairy Tale | *
* Sprint Shoes on someone helps. Rude | --NULLIFY: | GRV----- | GRV------- | *
* is the healer of the two, but don't |____________________________________| *
* finish one off before the other                                            *
* because as soon as one of them has been defeated they'll both run off      *
* together, meaning you won't get EXP, AP etc. for the pair of them. In      *
* other words, wait until both of their health is below 800 then cast Beta   *
* or Aqualung to kill them both in one hit and thus getting the max amount   *
* of rewards. Reno will drop the [FAIRY TALE] for Aeris which has 8 slots!   *
*                                                                            *
%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%

When the battle has finished make sure to set up your Materia for Fire based
attacks, then head to the right. As you make your way down into the ruined
reactor you'll have to hide from the Shinra whilst listening in on their
plans.

After Scarlett and Tseng have departed, search the spot where Scarlett was
standing to GRAB THAT MATERIA! - the [TITAN MATERIA]! We now have an Earth
based Summon! Too bad that a heap of enemies are strong vs Earth, oh well!
Now make your way back to the crossroads where you met the Turks.

--D1.13 B - Gongaga Village            ("You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?")

--Items        - X-Potion, White M-Phone, Deathblow Materia
--Required gil - 17,000


 NOTE - (Best Bromance) Make a party of Aeris and Tifa and save your game.

  Make your way left at the first fork and then Right on the second fork.
Welcome to Gongaga, a broken rundown town, and it's all thanks to the Shinra.

Head into the first hut on the left to buy two new pieces of Materia -
Mystify - 6000 gil and Time - 6000 gil. You can buy a Fury Ring for 5000 gil
which save us having to win it at the Battle Square. You can also buy another
White Cape here for 5000 gil if you wish (I'm not bothering).

] You can now cast Haste for 18MP instead of having to use Big Guard, so     [
] whack an All=Time combo on someone and never take it out of your battle    [
] strategy! Also, if you're trying to learn an Enemy Skill from an enemy     [
] that can't be manipulated, you can cast Haste on them to make them attack  [
] you more frequently.                                                       [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

You could climb up the pole here for the Weapon Shop, but it doesn't stock
anything new. Head to the western most hut to rest for 80 gil, and also to
loot a chest containing an [X-POTION].

Now head into the hut just north of the inn to find another chest containing
a weapon for Cait Sith, the [WHITE M-PHONE].

Now head to the south eastern huts and enter into the northern hut first to
stock up on a few items. I suggest leaving with a minimum of 10 Tents,
Maiden's Kiss's, Cornucopias, Softs & Phoenix Downs. Remember you can sell a
few Ethers for 750 gil if you must.

Now head into the last hut to find out a little bit about a character named
(Zack). Again, this scene will play out differently depending on who is in
your party, and you may need to talk to you friends first before they'll re-
join you.

 NOTE - (Best Bromance) Leave Gongaga now without talking to Aeris or Tifa.
        Although their affection value will drop, you'll be missing out on a
        small amount of dialogue, so If you're keen on hearing what they have
        to say then you can talk to them now, but then you'll have to re-load
        your save so that you can completely ignore them (you do have a small
        margin for error with this trophy by the way).

We're all done with Gongaga now, well almost. Head out of the village and
this time take the left (and last) fork picking up the [DEATHBLOW MATERIA]
along the way.

Head out of Gongaga and travel west through the forest to eventually be able
to cross a river.

 NOTE - Although Deathblow is a handy Materia to have, it doesn't get its own
        side note box or anything, just a few line breaks & spaces as it
        isn't really all that game-changing. You will hit with a critical
        blow IF you hit; your accuracy drops by 33% (only while you are using
        Deathblow, selecting your normal attack will still retain its normal
        accuracy). The best use for Deathblow is when you have your Limit
        Break up and you're saving it for a Boss, you can use Deathblow as an
        alternative to attacking.
