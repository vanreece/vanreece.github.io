--Items - Elixir, Elemental Materia, Star Pendant, Four Slots, All Materia,
          Phoenix Down, Ether
--Extra - Turtle Paradise Poster #2, Keycard 60, Keycard 62, Keycard 65,
          A Coupon, B Coupon, C Coupon, Midgar Parts x 5, Keycard 66


  When you first arrive at the Shinra's HQ you'll have the option to bust in
guns blazin', or sneak in through the back. Obviously you know which my
choice is gonna be, I'm looking on getting some Tifa kills with the
All=Lightning combo at this point, so I'm bustin in through the front. You'll
be able to come back for the item in the back entrance later on.

 NOTE - Your choice here will not affect Tifa's or Barret's affection towards
        you. Also, if you choose one route, you can still opt to change your
        mind.

The Back Entrance.

 Head left, you have a long climb ahead of you. Just after half way up the
 tremendously long stair case you'll come across an [Elixir] for you
 troubles. When you (finally) get to the top, you'll have to fight 3 Mighty
 Grunts in order to obtain the Keycard 60.

The Front Entrance.

 As you enter, you'll have defeat a few Grenade Combatants. Once they're out
 of the way, head north west on the 1st Floor to the big billboard to read
 the [Turtle Paradise Poster #2]. Then, head up to the 2nd Floor and into
 the shop to stock up on a few Eyedrops (I bought 8). You won't be able to
 open those chests just yet, but you can watch a few promotional Shinra vids
 from the terminals to the left.

 There is nothing on the 3rd Floor, so just head into the lifts. On your way
 up you'll have to fight a number of enemies until you finally reach the 59th
 Floor, where you'll then have to kill 3 x Mighty Grunts for the Keycard 60.

Whichever path you took, consider now tracing back to the other path; if you
bust your way in all guns blazin', you could now head down the huge staircase
on the left if you wanted to for the Elixir roughly half way down (it's
quicker to double back once you've obtained it).

If you'd sneaked in through the back entrance then at this point you are
really going to want to head back down to the 1st floor in the elevator to
visit the shop for a few Eyedrops, but more importantly the Billboard on the
1st Floor for the Turtle Paradise Poster #2.

 NOTE - This Turtle Paradise Poster is permanently missable! Don't worry
        if you did miss it here, as you will get one more chance in the game
        to examine it. This won't be until much, much later on though.

 Shinra HQ - 60th Floor:

We now have a series of floors we must ascend by finding their corresponding
Key cards on the floors below them. Whilst on the 60th Floor, you will have 2
sets of guards that you must navigate past. It's simple enough to work out.
If you get caught you will have to fight them, and if you get caught 4 times
then they will have vanished completely after the battle (unfortunately). Now
Head up to the 61st Floor.

 Shinra HQ - 61st Floor:

All you have to do here is talk to the guy walking around in the grey suit.
Simply choose dialogue option 2 and he'll give you Keycard 62.

 Shinra HQ - 62nd Floor:

There is a highly missable piece of Materia here, so head back to the 1st
floor and save your game. Then head back up to the 62nd Floor and talk to
Mayor Domino on the left side to engage him in a quiz. Guess right and he'll
give you Keycard 65. Guess right on the 1st try then he'll throw in the
highly under-rated [ELEMENTAL MATERIA]. The answer changes from game to game
so if you don't guess correctly on your first try then just keep guessing
until you've got the right answer, then reload your save. You WILL be
thankful you did this. I'll explain the most proficient ways of using the
Elemental Materia a little later on (when we obtain the Choco/Mog Materia).

 NOTES - There is a way to know the password on the first try. Go to the upper-
         right room (Space Dev. Research Library) and check the middle left
         bookshelf. if the file is :

           2 Economic Report: Space Dev Program      Password  BEST
           1 Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class   Password  BOMB
          10 New plans for urban planning            Password  MAKO
           1 Result of failed space mission "YA-79"  Password  KING
                                                Thanks to BrutalAl on this one

       - If you get the password correct on your 2nd attempt then you will
         receive an Elixir, get it on your 3rd attempt for an Ether, and get
         it on your 4th attempt for a Potion.

       - The password can only ever be Best, Bomb, Mako or King, and is
         selected based on how many seconds you have been playing.


 Shinra HQ - 63rd Floor:

The next two floors are optional but I highly recommend that you don't skip
them as you'll being missing out otherwise. Examine the terminal on the right
to start a Mini-Game of sorts. You have three doors to open and three items
to obtain. If you mess up you can reset the doors by using the terminal to
try again.

First head all the way east then north round to the upper most door. Open it,
from there you should be able to get into the western most room by opening
one more door. Pick up the A Coupon which can be exchanged for the [STAR
PENDANT] (don't exchange it just yet).

Then head into the air-duct and make you way east and then north to bring you
out at the eastern room containing the B Coupon which can be exchanged for
the [FOUR SLOTS]. Head out of this room and open your last door for the C
Coupon which can be exchanged for the [ALL MATERIA].

Now head back into the air-duct and this time take the route back to the
terminal. Here you can exchange your Coupons for their prizes. My suggestion
is to give Cloud the second All combined with Restore so we don't have to
keep swapping our Materia around every time we want do the 'All Trick'. Also,
Four Slots is a piece of armour that has (you guessed it) four Materia slots,
but also has low defence stats. The Star Pendant can be equipped as an
accessory which can protect you from Poison, this will help a little later.
Equip it to Cloud, if you wish.

 Shinra HQ - 64th Floor

Not much to do here. You can head to the left to rest up for free, just
remember that you may need to give someone a Hyper if you're Limit Training
them as resting will cure you of Fury Status. Save if you wish, then head to
the northern room with all of the lockers in. Search the southern strip for a
[PHOENIX DOWN], the middle strip for an [ETHER] and the northern strip for a
Megaphone that Cloud has no use for at this moment in time.

 NOTE - *Make sure* to try to use the vending machine in the gym. Bang on it
        if you have to, nothing will come out of it, yet..... (but do bang
        on it)

 Shinra HQ - 65th Floor

You can encounter enemies here by the way. Dotted around the room are several
chests, only one will be open at a time (at random). Once you've found the
unlocked chest, take its contents to the middle room where you will be able
to place it down, thereby opening up another chest. Repeat this process until
all but one piece has been placed (because there is no Sector 7 anymore), and
the chest by the stairs will unlock granting us the Keycard 66.

 Shinra HQ - 66th Floor

Here you are required to spy on a meeting. Head over to the toilet cubicles
at the top left of the screen and examine one of the cubicles to climb up.
Crawl down the shaft to eves-drop on President Shinra's meeting. Here is
where we first meet Professor Hojo and also learn the name of Aeris's
biological mother, Ifalna. Once the meeting has finished follow Hojo up to
the next floor and into his lab.

                                                     thousands of years ago.")

          equipment), Keycard 68


  When you make your way up to the new floor, it would be advisable at this
point to battle around for a bit to try and steal 3 Carbon Bangles from the
Moth Slashers. Equip your new armour, then head west and after hiding from
Hojo, Cloud will examine the nearby tank to see some weird creature named
Jenova incubating inside.

Once you have regained control of Cloud, head north to find a chest
containing the [POISON MATERIA] and a save point. One of your teammates is
going to have to leave us in just a sec so decide now which one you want that
to be (Best Bromance - choose Barret) and remove any good armour and Materia
that they have. Heal up, then make your way into the lift.

Once you've reached the top you'll engage in some conflict with Hojo, then
you'll be able to name a new character [RED XIII]. Without much of a chance
to set up you'll be flung into a boss battle!

After the battle you shall get an opportunity to arrange the characters that
you would like to have in your party. I decided to have Barret and Red XIII
(Best Bromance - choose the same party members), so first I put Tifa in party
then I used the 'Remove All' option (from the 'Arrange' tab in 'Materia'),
then I exchanged her armour and removed her accessory. Once Red XIII and
Barret were loaded with the best equipment, I set up my Materia with the
following:

 1) Cloud - Lv 15 (Front)

     Buster Sword  - All=Restore
     Carbon Bangle - Fire, Lightning, Steal
     Star Pendant

 2) Barret - Lv 14 (Front)

     Assault Gun   - All=Fire
     Carbon Bangle - Elemental=Poison, Ice
     Talisman

 3) Red XIII - Lv 15 (Front)

     Mythril Clip - All=Lightning, Sense
     Four Slots   - Restore, Ice, Cover, Cover

 NOTE - Equipping the Elemental combo onto a character's armour will have a
        different affect to placing it on a characters weapon. This doesn't
        matter for now, I just thought I'd mention it. I'm only equipping
        Elemental now as so that it starts receiving AP. More Elemental
        details on the way. Also note that Red XIII came with an All, so we
        can now have one on each character!

GRAB THAT MATERIA! Pick up the [ENEMY SKILL MATERIA] that you see in the test
chamber. You don't need to worry about equipping this just yet, I'll explain
what it's all about in a short while (Enemy Skill does not gain AP!).

Battle around for a little while until you encounter SOLDIER:3rd. You are
going to want to try to steal a weapon for Cloud - the Hardedge from them,
although it can be notoriously hard to do so. It took me roughly 10 minutes!
Try to get a few uses of Red XIII's 1-1 while your here, if you can.

Head south from where you picked up the Enemy Skill to find a set of stairs
leading to 2 [POTIONS]. You can talk to the chap in the Control Centre for
the Keycard 68. Head back down the stairs and then to the right to find
another 2 [POTIONS].

Now head back to the main elevator shaft, remembering to equip Cloud's
Hardedge if you managed to obtain one. Also un-equip any armour/accessories
you have equipped on Red or Barret. We're about to run into a small bit of
bother!

 NOTE - You won't be able to encounter the enemies that drop the Carbon Bangle
        and the Hardedge past this point.

--Boss - Hundred Gunner Lv 18 + Heli Gunner Lv 19 (Mythril Armlet),

         Motor Ball Lv 19 (Star Pendant)


  So you've wound up in Shinra's Security cells. Bummer. You can talk to your
friends here for some (affection) dialogue, then when you're ready you can
get some shut-eye. (Best Bromance - When talking to Tifa, choose option 2,
"Kinda Hard". Then think of Barret first, and Red XIII second)

 NOTE - There is a glitch you can exploit here to raise Tifa's affection
        towards you indefinitely. See section E.01 B for more details, or use
        QSI Link [Speed Dating]. Remember, copy Speed Dating into the search
        field, replacing the [] with {} to jump straight to that relevant
        section. This does work in the Steam/PS4 versions.

When you awaken you'll notice something weird is going on. Take a look around
and eventually you'll have to follow RED XIII out of the cells. Set up your
new party with the best equipment and give both girls the All=Ice combo, not
forgetting to give Hypers out to those who are Limit Leveling!

Make your way round to Hojo's lab to find out the possible cause for all the
weirdness. Head to the northern lift. Follow the trail of blood all the way
to the 69th Floor where you can save; I recommend doing so. Also, replace
Tifa's Carbon Bangle with something else before moving up to the 70th Floor.

 NOTE - When we continue on all of our HP & MP will be restored.

Head upstairs to find a few shocking revelations and then head through the
northern door. Eventually you will have the option to remove all of Cloud and
Tifa's Materia. Select yes, give Barret the Carbon Bangle then consider the
following set up (And yes I am equipping certain Materias just for the sake
of equipping them, like Enemy Skill):

 1) Aeris - Lv 12 (Back)

     Striking Staff - All=Restore, Sense, Steal
     Carbon Bangle  - Lightning, Poison, Enemy Skill
     Talisman

 2) Barret - Lv 14 (Back)

     Assault Gun   - Elemental=Lightning
     Carbon Bangle - All=Ice, Fire

 3) Red XIII - Lv 15 (Back)

     Mythril Clip  - All=Restore, Sense
     Carbon Bangle - Ice, Fire, Cover

] It is crucial to point out that I have equipped Barret with the            [
] Elemental=Lightning combo on his weapon and not his armour. The following  [
] few Bosses are weak vs Lightning attacks and with this combo attached to   [
] Barret's weapon it will make his attacks lightning based hitting for extra [
] damage. If you had attached it to his armour by mistake then he would be   [
] defending from Lightning based attacks which would be pointless at this    [
] stage.                                                                     [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

Depending on where you are with your Limit Breaks and how many Hypers you
have remaining, you may want to give Barret and/or Red XIII one to get a few
uses from their Limits. When you're ready, head over to the elevators to
engage in not one but two Boss battles! (Even though the battle music
suggests otherwise...)

As soon as this battle has finished you'll be back with Cloud and Rufus.
Press Sq when prompted to remove everyone's Materia, then set Cloud up with
something like this:

 1) Cloud - Lv 15 (Front)

     Hardedge      - All=Poison, Restore, Ice
     Carbon Bangle - Elemental=Lightning, Fire

%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%

As soon as the battle is done head back down to the 69th Floor. Save if you
wish then talk to Tifa to make our POV change to our other team. After a cool
FMV you'll have an opportunity to swing your sword about a bit, and set up a
party. I went with:

 1) Cloud - Lv 16 (Back)

     Hardedge      - All=Restore, Lightning, Ice
     Carbon Bangle - Elemental=Fire, Enemy Skill
     Star Pendant

 2) Barret - Lv 14 (Front)

     Assault Gun   - All=Restore
     Carbon Bangle - All=Fire, Steal
     Talisman

 3) Red XIII - Lv 15 (Back)

     Mythril Clip  - Lightning, Ice, Sense
     Carbon Bangle - Poison, Sense, Cover, Cover
     Protect Vest

I have set up my party in the reverse of their normal rows for this fight for
reasons that'll make sense in just a sec, for now we have a Mini-Game to play!

* This boss has an incredibly powerful       | ---------Lv: | 19---------- | *
* attack, Rolling Fire which can deliver     | ---------HP: | 2600-------- | *
* roughly 250HP to all allies, so make sure  | ---------MP: | 120--------- | *
* to keep your HP topped up. Your rows will  | --------EXP: | 440--------- | *
* be automatically reversed to whatever you  | ---------AP: | 45---------- | *
* had set them to, which is why I'd advised  | --------GIL: | 350--------- | *
* you to put your characters in the back row | -------DROP: | Star Pendant | *
* earlier. Bolt is your best friend here, so | ----NULLIFY: | GRV--------- | *
* just let Cloud and Red XIII fry the Motor  | ------HALVE: | FRE--------- | *
* Ball while Barret heals the group and then | -----DOUBLE: | LHT--------- | *
* attacks him normally. Don't forget to      |_____________________________| *
* sense him aswell so that you can see his                                   *
* remaining HP. He can deliver a few powerful Fire based moves here, which   *
* is why I'd recommended the Elemental=Fire combo on Cloud's armour. Lastly, *
* don't use Fire based spells as they will inflict 1/2 the normal damage.    *
* Once he's been annihilated you'll be rewarded with the [STAR PENDANT].     *
*                                                                            *

Once you've jumped down to the outskirts of Midgar you'll be able to engage
in some optional dialogue. When you're ready, go to leave the south screen to
be prompted to set up a party (Best Bromance - choose Barret & Red XIII).
When you're ready, head outside to the vast and wonderful World Map!

 NOTES - Very shortly we will gain the ability to swap our players around at
         will, so don't worry trying to decide on the best character to pick
         just yet.

       - There are two amazing spots in this game for Leveling up our Limit
         Breaks, the first of which we will be arriving at pretty shortly.

       - Red XIII's 1-2 Limit is a really effective method to defeating one
         soon-to-fight mega hard boss, as it will caste Haste and raise the
         defence of all allies, so try to learn it soon (8 uses of Sled Fang).
