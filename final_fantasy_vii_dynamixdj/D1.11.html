--D1.11 A - Gold Saucer   ("What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose
                                                            something dear.")

--Required gil - 3000
--Extra        - Silver Armlet (recruit equipment), Manipulate Materia
                (recruit equipment), Transform Materia (recruit equipment)


 Welcome to the Gold Saucer. The entrance fee is 3000 gil, or you can buy a
lifetime pass for 30,000 gil. I'm expecting you to not have a spare 30,000
knocking about, so just buy the single pass for now. Note that like many
things in the Gold Saucer, you have to pay for the save point using GP. GP
being the currency used here and it is obtained either by playing arcade
games in the Wonder Square or by winning at the Chocobo Races.

] Very uncommonly you'll see a man standing beside the save point who will   [
] convert 100 gil into 1 GP, with a maximum of 100 GP for 10,000 gil. To     [
] save any confusion, this man will NOT appear until you are at a certain    [
] point on Disk 2. A lot of people tend to waste time here running back and  [
] forth from screen to screen trying to make him appear on Disk 1, all in    [

As you enter into the foyer you'll have some dialogue to read, then Barret'll
storm off through the Wonder Square portal. Pick one character that you'd
like to accompany you then follow Barret through the giant hole to the Wonder
Square (Best Bromance - Speak to Tifa first then choose not to go with her.
it doesn't matter who you choose after that, so long as you have declined
Tifa first. Only speak to Tifa first if you've been following my guide to the
very letter, if you've made a few mistakes then talk to Aeris first and tell
her not to go with you).

NOTE - There is a lot to do in the Gold Saucer, and when the time is right I
       will guide you through to all of the places of interest. For now
       however this is going to be a relatively short visit.

When we get to the Wonder Square We'll meet a new character [CAIT SITH]. Once
he has joined your party you can look at his Materia to see that you have now
obtained the Manipulate Materia! Yesss. Feel free to head further into the
Wonder Square, there are a number of mini-games to play here. Again, we will
be visiting this area more in depth a little later on.

NOTE - If you can master the Super Dunk game now you can save a bit of time
       later on. Try to save up as much GP as possible, you'll need it for
       the Battle Square (If you happen to be using an emulator you can
       quite easily rack up loads of GP very quickly here due to the fact
       that you'd be able save and load your state. You could also then buy
       the Golden Ticket from the clerk by the Arm Wrestling machine).

You can (optionally) head over to the Speed Square to speak to the owner of
the Gold Saucer to learn a few things about our adversary. Then head over to
the Battle Square and after a few scenes have played out you will get thrown
down the Gateway To Heaven (why couldn't Cloud have just used Bolt?).

--Boss - Dyne Lv 23 (Silver Armlet)


 What a terrible judicial system the Gold Saucer has! No trial or nothing!?!
Now that we have seen what Barret may be capable of, it's time to find out
what his side of the story is. Head south to have a quick moment with the
troubled fella, then follow him south to the next screen.

Unless you're planning to use Cait Sith, I suggest removing his Silver
Armlet. If you wanted to you could head into the lorry to the south to have a
quick chat with Mr Coates about possibly leaving the prison, and you can also
rest up in the cab of the truck for free. Head into the south eastern house
to buy a few items, and when you're ready to continue head into the larger
house just north of the previous one (this happens to be the same house from
the flashback).

Now you'll see another flashback that will uncover certain truths to the
whole story. Select your 3rd party member then set yourselves up something
like this: (Note that you can talk to your other team mates to re-select your
party) (Best Bromance - choose Red XIII to accompany you and Barret. *DO NOT*
choose Aeris, as she gains a huge boost if you do, and you'll have completely
ruined your progress so far)

1) Cloud - Lv 21 (Front)

    Hardedge    - All= Fire, Revive, Heal
    Shinra Beta - All=Restore, Earth, Steal
    Talisman

2) Red XIII - Lv 20 (Back)

    Diamond Pin   - Elemental=Shiva, Seal, Enemy Skill
    Silver Armlet - All=Lightning, Manipulate, Long Range
    Power Wrist

3) Barret - Lv 19 (Front)

    Atomic Scissors - Poison, Restore, HP Plus, Steal
    Shinra Beta     - All=Ice, Enemy Skill, Sense
    Protect Vest

NOTES - Make sure that Barret doesn't have the empty Enemy Skill equipped.

      - The southern house has a bar where you can buy a few worthless
        items. It's not really worth visiting.

Once you're all set make your way north. Here you'll see a well, you can take
a look inside if you wish but there's not much to see other than an empty
chest. The skeleton that you see here is actually the remains of a the 'Test
0' enemy. This well was basically a testing ground for the Developers, and in
the original Japanese version you could still fight these test enemies here;
they had extremely high amounts of HP and would not attack. There is also a
very weird looking hidden 'Red Man' hiding in the background layers of the
graphics. Trivia over.

You'll have a choice in which way to go next; take the left path to continue
on with the story (scrapyard), or take the right path to engage in some
optional battles with the Land Worm to try and steal some Turbo Ethers, and
the Cactuar to try and earn some gil (10,000 per battle). Note that after a
dozen screens or so a Chocobo carriage will appear to take you back to the
central prison. Also, you may end up randomly appearing at the scrapyard
(left path).

NOTE - Once you have finished up with Corel Prison you will never be able to
       return to it. You will however be able to return to the desert to
       fight the Land Worm and Cactuar again, so if you don't want to battle
       them now then that's fine. You can come back once you have obtained
       the Enemy Skills Big Guard and White Wind. The scrapyard cannot be
       revisited),

Take the left path and then follow the fence through the opening to the north
of the fissure to wind up in the scrapyard. Do not go into the next screen
until you have obtained all of the Steals and Enemy Skills that you plan to
obtain (Platinum Bangle, Laser and Matra Magic). Remember you can manipulate
your foes to make them cast the spell of your choice, on the party member of
your choice. If you don't get the Laser E-Skill here then you won't be able
to obtain it until you reach disk 3, and you really are going to want to
learn it here as it depletes an enemies HP by 50%.

NOTE - As with the Steal Materia, the Manipulate has a higher chance of
       success the higher the users Lv is.

If you'd set up Barret as I'd advised earlier then you shouldn't need to swap
anything around, otherwise bear in mind that the following Boss battle is a
Barret only battle, so make sure Barret has the 'better' Enemy Skill
equipped, and that he has full HP. Head north and you'll engage with one of
Barret's old friends. Unfortunately, things don't quite turn out for the best.

--D1.11 C - Chocobo Racing to Freedom!    ("Why don't you get his autograph?")

--Items - Ramuh Materia


 Once the battle has finished you'll have a few touching scenes followed by
an amount of dialogue including a lesson on how to ride Chocobos. When you
finally regain control of Cloud in the Jockey's room, GRAB THAT MATERIA!
You'll be able to make out the shining [RAMUH MATERIA] at the top right of
the screen (grab it). We now have a Lightning based Summon, hoo-rah(muh)! If
you missed it here then it is lost forever and you'll have to reload your
save.

After all the Jockeys have left Ester will come and grab you to enter you
into the race. You can listen again on how to ride a Chocobo, or you can
listen to my expert advice:

] The main thing to remember is to keep R1+R2 held down at all times, this   [
] will gradually refill your Stamina bar. As soon as the race begins press   [
] Select to gain manual control of the Chocobo, then press Square a number   [
] of times until he is running as fast as he can go. With R1+R2 held down he [
] should still be regaining Stamina, so every now and then hold down O in    [
] short bursts to sprint, making sure to save enough for the final dash.     [
] Once you and Number 2 have crossed the finish line you can press Start to  [
] end the race. It really isn't too hard, but if you do lose you will be     [
] able to try again until you win.                                           [
]____________________________________________________________________________[

After the race you'll be told that there is a gift waiting for us... A buggy
(along with the Chocochampion Trophy)! We can now cross Deserts and Rivers!
That, accompanied by the fact that we now have the Manipulate Materia means
that there is a world of side-quests for us to now do! Bear in mind that you
can still engage in random battles whilst driving around in your buggy.
