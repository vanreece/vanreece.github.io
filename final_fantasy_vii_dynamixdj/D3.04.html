!!WELCOME BACK!!

I plan to divide this final section into 5 sub-sections, but before doing
anything else I'd just like to quickly conclude the storyline:

 NOTE - In the final scene with Red XIII, I'm sure the cliff side that they
        all convened on was the exact same cliff where Zack had died...

The very final fight in the game appears to be a fight of the mind, there are
numerous things pointing towards this. After all, Sephiroth's main weapon
throughout the game was his will, remember he remained encapsulated within
the North Crater the entire time whilst creating copies of himself using only
the power of his mind (cast your own mind back to the quote from your first
visit to Wall Market - "It's started moving", this was a reference to
Sephiroth's awakening). I believe that Cloud had destroyed what remained of
Sephiroth's psyche during that final fight, once he was defeated there was
nothing holding the White Materia back from activating Holy.

 NOTE - I find it interesting to see blood on Sephiroth's face. So if blood
        was acceptable on a Teen rated game in 1997, why then did Aeris shed
        no blood when Sephiroth penetrated her with his long Masamune blade?
        Maybe the Cetra can't shed blood, or maybe it wasn't the real Aeris,
        it was just an Aeris-bot of which the Shinra had mass produced
        thousands of on the down-low. Or more realistically, maybe the Dev's
        had filled Disk 1 up with so much info that they just couldn't
        squeeze that extra little bit of red-ness onto Sephiroth's sword?!?

Black Materia. Used for summoning the 'Ultimate Destruction Magic' (or
Meteor), which will cause mass destruction to the planet. White Materia. Used
for summoning 'Ultimate White Magic' (or Holy), which will save the planet
from Meteor, as well as anything else that the Planet deems to be 'bad' for
it. As Sephiroth killed Aeris she was seemingly praying, but what she was
actually doing was asking the planet to activate her White Magic. Just before
she died the Planet had received Aeris's prayer and activated the White
Materia, however Sephiroth's will was suppressing its effects, meaning that
Holy could not be summoned. That was just a re-cap of what you learned at the
Forgotten Capitol with Bugenhagen.

After Cloud had defeated Sephiroth's will, the White Materia was no longer
subdued and the power of Holy was released. This was the blue wave that you
saw destroy the Meteor's red tornadoes. Unfortunately, Meteor was already too
close to hitting the planet and Holy's power alone wasn't enough to defeat it
(not without gravely harming the Planet anyway). The thing that isn't clearly
explained to us is what takes place next. Aeris, although dead hasn't fully
returned to the planet yet, and sensing the Planets need for help she summons
the power of Lifestream to aid Holy. The Lifestream then pushed Meteor back
far enough for Holy to work its magic, thus destroying Meteor for good. What
remains of the White and Black Materia remains unknown, what is known is that
the planet decided to spare the humans and life on the planet continued.

 NOTES - As explained in the film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, when
         Cloud defeated Sephiroth his remnants still remained within the
         Lifestream, and as a result of Lifestream flooding the planet many
         people got sick with a disease called Geostigma. Subsequently, the
         Jenova DNA that was contained within the Geostigma was enough for a
         second reunion to take place two years after the events of FF VII.

       - Advent Children was crap, so don't waste your time on it. If you
         want something to watch then check out Final Fantasy VII Last Order
         which is a 25 minute manga-style film based on the events of the
         Nibelheim Incident 5 years ago. Or even watch Crisis Core: Final
         Fantasy VII Full Film [HD] if you have the time, it's a 2 and a half
         hour film taken from the game Crisis Core.

  The first thing you're going to want to do is to ascend all the way to the
top of the crater so you can PHS and strip everybody down. Make sure to equip
everyone who isn't in your team with 8-slotted weapons and armour. If you're
not using the W-Item trick, then I highly suggest stocking up on a load of
Tents right about now.

Set up a party with Yuffie and Cid and then make your way to the swamp area
on the upper-left path. Remember that the 1st screen has a higher encounter
chance than the second. What we are mainly concentrating on here is preparing
for the Gelnika whilst loosely thinking about the WEAPON battles.
Here is the load-out I recommend starting out with:

 1) Cloud - Lv 78 (Front)

     Apocalypse  - Quadra Magic, Sneak Attack, Magic Counter,
     Rune Armlet - Mime, Counter Attack, Mega All, EXP Plus
     Safety Bit

 2) Yuffie - Lv 67 (Back)

     Rising Sun  - Final Attack=Revive, Added Effect=Hades
     Rune Armlet - Magic Counter, Counter, Slash-All, Enemy Lure
     Curse Ring

 3) Cid - Lv 70 (Front)

     Scimitar    - Morph, Knights of the Round
     Rune Armlet - Added Cut, Counter, Double Cut, Counter Attack
     Ribbon

This load-out should make it so you can still defend yourself adequately in
battle whilst also Leveling up the Materia necessary for becoming a God. Note
that Knights of the Round must stay in your load out as it requires by far
the most amount of AP to master - 500,000!

 NOTES - Ruby and Emerald WEAPON will each give 50,000 AP. Combine that with
         Triple Growth weapons and you're talking 300,000  AP!

       - Go into Config and turn the Battle Speed up all the way.

Your main goal is to obtain the following before heading out of the North
Crater:

3 x Morph
1 x Sneak Attack (Mastered)
1 x Counter (Mastered)
2 x Mime

If you wanted to master 3 Morphs for a fourth copy so that you can pair one
with Steal as well then that would be fine (the first two are being paired
with 2 Sneak Attacks, and third is being paired with Counter). Also, aim to
get three Added Effects with Hades as they are awesome. You cannot use
Counter Attacks in the Gelnika as it will ruin your Morphing chances so try
to Master a few now, you're eventually going to want 9 of them mastered in
total (for Emerald). 3 Final Attacks with 3 Revives should be on your to-get
list, and also 2 mastered Enemy Lures (as they will stack).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  Watch your Elixir count! There's nothing worse than being
                  in a battle with the Magic Pots with no Elixirs; they'll
 WORD OF WARNING! steal from you then they'll run away, so your only option
                  would be to flee yourself before they've stolen your most
                  valuable weapon!!!

] SIDE NOTE - EXTENDED W-ITEM TRICK (works on PS4 version)                   [
]                                                                            [
] While the W-Item trick is widely known about, not a great deal of folk are [
] aware of some of the more practical uses of how it can work; I wasn't when [
] I first wrote this portion of the guide, so I've include it now as an      [
] addition. I'm now going to breakdown exactly how to use the Extended       [
] W-Item trick to explain how to duplicate yourself every type of Source     [
] MUCH quicker than the 'Sunken Gelnika' method:                             [
]                                                                            [
]   First make sure that you have *one* expendable item at the top of the    [
]   inventory list (such as a Potion), then make sure that you have 0 of     [
]   the item you wish to duplicate (say, a Power Source). Depending on the   [
]   enemy formation, you may have a few variations to set-up for. Set the    [
]   ATB to wait.                                                             [
]                                                                            [
]  MULTIPLE GROUPS OF ENEMIES (Power, Guard, Speed and Luck Source)          [
]                                                                            [
] Set Yuffie up with Morph, Cloud with Manipulate and player 3 with W-Item.  [
] When you engage the enemy, make sure to kill off all but 2 of them, and    [
] Manipulate one of them. Now have Yuffie cast Morph. Before the move is     [
] executed, have player 3 use W-Item, and use the single Potion as your      [
] first item. Now wait for the enemy to be Morphed into the Source.          [
]                                                                            [
] If done correctly, the Source will fill the same inventory slot that was   [
] occupied by the Potion. You can now select and cancel another item,        [
] thereby duplicating the Power Sources up to 99.                            [
]                                                                            [
]  - Power Source - Screamer, Mt Nibel,       Screen with the Reactor        [
]  - Guard Source - Spiral,   Mideel Area,    Dirt tracks                    [
]  - Speed Source - Poodler,  Sunken Gelnika, Hallway                        [
]  - Luck  Source - Poodler,  Sunken Gelnika, Hallway                        [
]                                                                            [
]  INDIVIDUAL ENEMY (Mind Source)                                            [
]                                                                            [
] As before, make sure to have *one* expendable item at the top of the       [
] inventory list, and to have 0 of the item you wish to duplicate. Set Cloud [
] up with Final Attack=Revive and Quadra Magic=Revive. Set Yuffie up with    [
] Final Attack=Morph, and lastly set player 3 up with W-Item. *MAKE SURE*    [
] that Yuffie is player 1 (at the top) so that she uses Morph before Cloud   [
] uses Life2. Remember to equip Enemy Skill, Cure and to have some Phoenix   [
] Downs.                                                                     [
]                                                                            [
] Enter into battle with the Serpent. Make sure that Cloud's and Yuffie's HP [
] are in critical, then start bringing the Serpent's HP down using L4        [
] Suicide; it is more likely to cast Aqualung that way. The idea is to have  [
] Cloud and Yuffie KO'd at the same time. Yuffie will then retaliate by      [
] Morphing the Serpent into a Mind Source, and Cloud will cast Life2 four    [
] times.                                                                     [
]                                                                            [
] Prior to Yuffie using Morph, make sure that player 3 is sitting in the     [
] W-Item screen with the Potion 'used', awaiting input of the second item.   [
] If done correctly, the Potion's inventory slot will be filled with the     [
] Mind Source, you will then have time to dupe yourself 50 of them while     [
] Cloud casts Life2.                                                         [
]                                                                            [
] The Serpent's attacks are dependent on your party's average current HP and [
] the Serpents Current HP. If the Serpent's current HP is:                   [
]                                                                            [
]  -  0% -  20% of party's current HP, Dragon Dance is used.                 [
]  - 21% -  40% of party's current HP, Huge Tidal Wave is used.              [
]  - 41% -  80% of party's current HP, Aqualung is used.                     [
]  - 81% - 100% of party's current HP, Viper Breath is used.                 [
]                                                                            [
] Using L4 Suicide and Cure, you should be able to regulate the Serpent's HP [
] until it uses Aqualung.                                                    [
]                                                                            [
]  NOTES - If you happen to be playing on a Playstation console, then you    [
]          can simply open the lid, thereby not allowing the battle to       [
]          finish. This way you can dupe the Source without having to go     [
]          through the Final Attack method.                                  [
]                                                                            [
]        - Each additional Quadra Magic that you pair with Revive gives      [
]          Cloud *one* additional casting, for a maximum of 8; so 5 Quadra   [
]          Magics paired with Revive would enable Cloud to cast Revive 8     [
]          times, which would be enough to gain 99 Mind Sources in a single  [
]          battle.                                                           [
]                                                                            [
]  BATTLE ARENA (Magic Source)                                               [
]                                                                            [
] The only way to encounter a 'group' of enemies that can be morphed into a  [
] Magic Source is at the Battle Square - The 8 eye. These can be encountered [
] in round 3, and you have a 1/4 chance of fighting them. For this battle    [
] you must set Yuffie up with (mastered) Counter=Morph. It is imperative     [
] that you cast Stop, Sleep or Paralyzed on one of the 8 Eyes. When the      [
] other attacks, select the single Potion then wait for Yuffie to counter    [
] with Morph. So long as the other 8 Eye cannot attack, you will be able to  [
] dupe yourself 99 Magic Sources. Don't equip Mega All, do equip Seal and    [
] (obviously) W-Item.                                                        [
]                                                                            [
] To read up on a few more uses for the Extended W-Item Trick, such as       [
] duplicating Weapons, Armour and Accessories, use QSI Link [Extended W-Item [
] Trick].                                                                    [

If you're not keen on making use of exploits, and you'd rather obtain your
Sources the old fashioned way, then continue reading. If you're not bothered
about Source farming in the slightest then skip to section D3.04 C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--D3.04 B - The Sunken Gelnika Re-visited


  Before making you way to your sub I suggest making a stop at the reactor in
Gongaga to fight the Heavy Tank. This is (in my opinion) the easiest way to
obtain Power Sources (without using exploits) and will help you get Yuffie's
base damage to 9999 on her attacks. I obtained 50 of them and gave every
single one of them to her. Alternatively you can use the aforementioned
Extended W-Item trick to duplicate them using the Screamers in Mt. Nibel.

Here's a tip: With your Gold Chocobo on board your Highwind, land the
aircraft near the Desert surrounding the Gold Saucer. Then, ride your Gold
Chocobo over to your sub, then navigate the sub to the dock near the Gold
Saucer. Now go and retrieve your Gold Chocobo; you've now 'parked' your sub
much closer to the Sunken Gelnika!

I advise a set-up similar to the following: (M) = Master

 1) Cloud - Lv 82 (Front)

     Apocalypse  - Quadra Magic, Final Attack, Magic Counter
     Rune Armlet - Added Effect, Mime, EXP Plus, Hades
     Ribbon

 2) Yuffie - Lv 69 (Back)
                                      Enemy Lure(M), Enemy Lure(M), HP PLus(M)
     Conformer - Sneak Attack(M)=Morph(M), Counter(M)=Morph(M), Enemy Skill,
     Mystile   - Sneak Attack=Morph, MP Turbo=Ultima, Contain, Revive,
     Ribbon                                                           Mega All

 3) Cid - Lv 73 (Front)

     Scimitar    - Added Cut=Knights of Round
     Rune Armlet - Comet, Magic Counter, Counter, Double Cut
     Ribbon

 NOTES - This set-up will allow you to occasionally Morph your enemy twice
         from the outset, which will make the Gelnika a walk in the park!

       - Steam users - it's time to start mastering all of our Materia for
         the Materia Overlord Achievement, so you're going to want to start
         working your way down your Materia list soon.

       - PS4 users you have a choice - you can obtain the Transcendant
         Convoker Trophy (obtain the Master Summon Materia) by defeating
         Emerald WEAPON, then trading the item it gives you for the Master
         Materia, so you don't *have* to master one of every Materia. I would
         however advise considering mastering your Materia to obtain multiple
         sets of Master Materia as to become a God.

       - TAKE NOTE of the requirement list found the next section, D3.04 C.

Now make your way over to your sub and SAVE BEFORE SUBMERGING. You don't want
to lose all of those Power Sources do you? Avoiding Emerald, make your way
over to the Sunken Gelnika.

 NOTE - The amount of time you spend in the Gelnika is entirely up to you and
        it isn't at all necessary to max out your stats in order to defeat
        the WEAPONs; if you really don't want to spend too long down there
        then that's fine. Remember that if you get bored then you can
        alternate between training at the North Crater and the Gelnika
        (see the section below), and you can always make use of the Extended
        W-Item Trick.

How you distribute your Sources is up to you, but try to raise everyone's
Strength so that they are hitting for 9999 each. I'm giving Cloud *most* of
my Magic Sources, but again, I'm keen to raise Cid's and Yuffie's stats up
too (Magic Sources are much harder to come by than Power Sources, unless you
used the Extended W-Item trick on the 8 eye). Give Yuffie the first 20 or so
Luck and Speed Sources to keep her hitting for critical damage, hastily, then
spread the rest out evenly. Mind Sources and Guard Sources can also be evenly
distributed.

Here is a re-cap of the enemies you can fight here:

  HALLWAY:

 Poodler - 6000 HP - 70 AP - Morph: Speed Source - Steal: Turbo Ether
 Bad Rap - 9000 HP - 70 AP - Morph: Luck Source  - Steal: Ink

  CARGO ROOM/RESEARCH ROOM: (The Serpent can only be fought in the Cargo
Room.)

 Unknown   - 10,000 HP - 150 AP - Morph: Power Source - Steal: Fire Armlet
 Unknown 2 - 13,000 HP - 300 AP - Morph: Guard Source - Steal: Aurora Armlet
 Unknown 3 - 15,000 HP - 200 AP - Morph: Magic Source - Steal: Bolt Armlet
 Serpent   - 14,000 HP -  70 AP - Morph: Mind  Source - Steal: Water Ring

When I was ready to continue my base stats looked like this:

 NOTE - These are the stats I had *without* using the Extended W-Item trick,
        on my first playthrough:
             _____________ ______________ ___________
            | Cloud Lv 97 | Yuffie Lv 82 | Cid Lv 84 |

 NOTE - These are the stats I had *with* using the Extended W-Item trick, on
        my second playthrough:
             _____________ ______________ ___________
            | Cloud Lv 83 | Yuffie Lv 72 | Cid Lv 75 |

| Spirit--- | 97--------- | 110--------- | 108------ |
| Luck----- | 54--------- | 87---------  | 53------- |
|___________|_____________|______________|___________|

Remember to equip your characters with weapons that won't increase their raw
stats. Here are the best weapons to equip (for everybody):

Cloud     - Nail Bat
Barret    - Gatling Gun, Drill Arm, Rocket Punch or Pile Banger.
Tifa      - Leather Glove, Work Glove, or Master Fist.
Aeris     - Guard Stick or Mythril Rod.
Red XIII  - Magic Comb
Yuffie    - 4-Point Shuriken
Cait Sith - Battle Trumpet
Vincent   - Silver Rifle
Cid       - Mop

**Don't forget to save before you exit.**

Here is a quick re-cap of where each Source can be morphed:
(* = Extended W-Item Trick)

Power Source -  Heavy Tank - Reactor in Gongaga
               *Screamer   - Mt. Nibel, winding pathway to rector
                Unknown    - Sunken Gelnika Cargo Room

Guard Source - *Bagnadrana      - Mt. Corel Reactor
               *Spiral          - Mideel Area
                Unknown 2       - Sunken Gelnika Cargo Room
                Maximum Kimaira - Midgar Mako Cannon Area (& Battle Square)
                Armored Golem   - Northern Cave

Magic Source -  Unknown 3 - Sunken Gelnika Cargo Room
               *8 eye     - Temple of The Ancients (& Battle Square)

Mind Source  -  Dragon Rider - Whirlwind Maze (& Battle Square)
                Killbin      - Whirlwind Maze (Can't re-visit)
               *Serpent      - Sunken Gelnika Cargo Room

Speed Source - *Poodler - Sunken Gelnika Hallway

Luck Source  - *Bad Rap - Sunken Gelnika Hallway

 NOTES - The dirt area near Mideel is the optimal place to battle the Spirals,
         which is preferable to fighting the Bagnadrana as they won't appear
         as often as the Spirals.

       - Have you noticed how 3 different reactors all have enemies that can
         be morphed into Sources? Corel, Gongaga & Nibelheim!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--D3.04 C - The Swamp Part II - Preparing for the WEAPONs


  Before doing anything else head over to Mideel and talk to the hyperactive
kid (or go to Costa Del Sol ). Buy 1 Gravity. If you don't already own 4
Deathblows then head over to Fort Condor to stock up on them.

 NOTE - The Allemagne (flying round creature) will may use L3 Flare as a
        counter to being hit with magic. Be very wary of L3 Flare as it can
        wipe your whole team out - stick to physical attacks

I'm not going to bother suggesting a load-out to you now as mine is
consistently changing. Right now you want to be concentrating on mastering
one of every Materia for the Materia Overlord Achievement (Steam), as well as
preparing yourself for Emerald and Ruby WEAPON.

It's worth noting that whilst Cloud's Apocalypse will give you 3 slots of
triple growth (meaning the equivalent of 9 slots), Cid's Scimitar will only
give you the equivalent of 6 slots (2 x triple growth).
Therefore, I highly recommend switching to Cid's Javelin as it offers 5 slots
at double growth, meaning it'll have the equivalent of 10 slots, which is the
most amount of AP that can be earned from one weapon. Just remember to keep
KOTR on a triple growth weapon.

 NOTES - Remember that Ruby and Emerald will each give out 50,000 AP, and in
         terms of preparation Ruby is by far the easiest. You could if you
         wanted to, hold out on Leveling up a few of the below Materias all
         the way (such as Magic Counter and Quadra Magic) for now, and use
         Ruby to finish Leveling them up seeing as you'll only really need 1x
         Knights of the Round and 3x Mime for her (and a few other bits).

       - I am preparing for the ultimate battle plan for Emerald WEAPON,
         which is why the following lists may look a little tedious. If
         you're familiar with the game and you have your own strategy then
         feel free to amend the following lists as you see fit. If you are
         new to the WEAPONs however then I recommend obtaining every single
         piece as listed.

       - Heard of All Lucky 7's? Visit section E.18 A and scroll down to
         method 5 to find an incredibly easy way to active 7777 fever,
         courtesy of James Baxter! Using Lucky 7's will make the WEAPONs that
         much easier...

       - Keep the EXP Plus and Gil Plus equipped to help for the relevant
         trophies. Enemy Lure help, also. Bear in mind that mastering All
         Materias is the easiest way to gain 99,999,999 gil...

Don't leave the Swamp until you have ticked off all of the following:
(again I emphasise the fact that this list is only necessary for the
'ultimate' strategy)

2 x Contain (Lv 4)
2 x Gravity (Lv 3)
3 x Revive (Lv 2)*
3 x Lightning (Lv 3)
3 x Quadra Magic (Mastered) Keep it in a triple growth weapon
3 X Final Attack (Lv 4)*
1 x MP Turbo (Mastered)*
3 x Magic Counter (Mastered) Keep in a triple growth weapon
3 x Counter (Mastered)
3 x Mime*
9 x Counter Attack (Mastered)
1 x Knights of Round (Mastered)* Keep in a triple growth weapon
                            * = All that is required for defeating Ruby WEAPON

The following isn't mandatory for beating the WEAPONs but will help:

2 x Mega All
1 x Double Cut (Lv 2) Remember - Mega All will override Double Cut.
2 x Long Range
2 x Magic Plus (Mastered)
1 x Phoenix (Mastered) (For Emerald WEAPON only)

The following won't be used in either WEAPON battle, but you will want to try
to fulfil this list only if you want to be a FF VII God:

3 x Ultima
3 x Contain (Lv 4)
3 x Steal as Well
3 x Added Cut
3 x Sneak Attack (Mastered)
3 x Added Effect
3 x Elemental (Mastered)
3 x HP Absorb
3 x MP Absorb
3 x MP Turbo (Mastered)
6 x Counter (Mastered)
5 x Morph
3 x Double Cut (Lv 2)
3 x Mega All
2 x Pre-Emptive (Mastered)
3 x Long Range
3 x Hades

Optional:

3 x Seal - Works brilliantly with Added Effect on all three players, can be
           bought from Costa Del Sol and Junon
7 x Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Gravity or Poison (Lv 3) - for an Ultimate
                                                           Materia Combination
3 x Alexander - For Holy Element
3 x Leviathan - For Water Element
3 x Choco/Mog - For Wind Element (or Typoon)

If Yuffie gets to level 99 then feel free to swap her over with your lowest
levelled player.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before heading over to defeat the WEAPONs you may want to consider stopping
off at the Gelnika one last time to give yourselves a quick stat boost. If
you are planning on doing this then I suggest walking away from the North
Crater at this stage with 4 Morphs, 2 to go with Mastered Sneak Attacks, 1 to
go with Steal as Well and one to go with a Mastered Counter.

Naturally, you could just make use of the Extended W-Item trick to gain one
more 'sweep' of Sources, just for the extra bit of unnecessary Over-Powered-
ness. During the course of everything I expect you to reach Lv 99 with Cloud,
unlocking the Liege of Leveling Trophy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the time I was ready to face the WEAPONs I'd managed to complete the first
and second list, with the exception of Magic Counter and Quadra Magic which
I'm using Ruby to help me finish off.

These were my finishing stats (at base level) on my first playthrough,
*without* using the Extended W-Item Trick:
             _____________ ______________ ___________
            | Cloud Lv 99 | Yuffie Lv 99 | Cid Lv 99 |
 ___________|_____________|______________|___________|
|           |             |              |           |
| Strength- | 148-------- | 187--------- | 137------ |
| Dexterity | 91--------- | 94---------- | 90------- |
| Vitality- | 134-------- | 134--------- | 135------ |
| Magic---- | 142-------- | 105--------- | 105------ |
| Spirit--- | 110-------- | 109--------- | 111------ |
| Luck----- | 71--------- | 72---------  | 75------- |
|___________|_____________|______________|___________|

These were my finishing stats on my second playthrough *with* the Extended W-
Item trick:
             _____________ ______________ ___________
            | Cloud Lv 99 | Yuffie Lv 85 | Cid Lv 88 |
 ___________|_____________|______________|___________|
|           |             |              |           |
| Strength- | 196-------- | 214--------- | 197------ |
| Dexterity | 185-------- | 170--------- | 147------ |
| Vitality- | 167-------- | 158--------- | 152------ |
| Magic---- | 210-------- | 142--------- | 143------ |
| Spirit--- | 141-------- | 130--------- | 128------ |
| Luck----- | 95--------- | 105--------  | 95------- |
|___________|_____________|______________|___________|

The highest any stat can reach is 255.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--D3.04 D - The Ultimate Battles

--Items - Gold Chocobo, Master Magic, Master Command, Master Summon
--Boss  - Ruby WEAPON Lv 59 (Desert Rose), Emerald WEAPON Lv 99 (Earth Harp)


RUBY WEAPON:


  Make sure that you have at least on Dazers and one Spider Web in your
inventory, then duplicate them both to around 25 (using the W-Item trick). If
you haven't got any then head over to Corral Valley (past Bone Village) to
fight the Boundfat for Dazers which you can steal, morph or simply wait for
them to drop one. Then head over to Gongaga to fight the Kimara Bug to steal
the Spider Web. Be sure to have roughly 15 Megalixirs also.

 NOTES - Go into your Item menu and re-arrange your items to suit. Place the
         Spider Web at the top, the Dazers second and the Megalixirs third.

       - Yuffie's Limit 3-2 Doom of The Living is actually better than her Lv
         4 Limit Break, All Creation!

Now fill up Yuffie's Limit gauge by giving her a Hyper, putting her in the
front row and then manipulating the Valrons near Nibelheim to make use of
their Dive Kick move. Now head over to the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer
to prepare yourself for the battle.

The first thing you are going to want to do is to kill off Cloud and Cid
(it'll make sense momentarily), then turn the Battle Speed all the way down
to 0 (trust me on this one). Afterwards you can set-up accordingly:

 1) Cloud (Back, KO'd)

 NOTE - Make sure that the Time you have given to Yuffie is Lv 1 or 2.

squirming about in the middle of the desert (or alternatively bump into it
with your Gold Chocobo).

* The attacks that the Tentacles use actually comes from Ruby itself, the    *

* based, and therefore cannot kill you. Once they have been defeated Ruby    *

* not becoming invincible), so it's advised that you just concentrate on     *
* Ruby leaving the Tentacles alone. Its attacks can be extraordinarily       *
* powerful, and should you cast KOTR on it then it'll counter attack by      *

*                                                                            *
* Ruby has three Status weaknesses, two of which we can exploit - Slow and   *
* Paralyze (Darkness cannot be exploited). As soon as the battle begins      *
* Yuffie should automatically put herself into Haste, then Ruby will bury    *
* its tentacles into the sand. Without hesitation, revive Cid and Cloud      *
* (using Life2 & Mega All), then use Yuffie's Limit Break. Have Cid cast     *
* W-Items Spider Web and then Dazers on it (in that order) to Slow then      *
* Paralyze it, followed by Big Guard from Cloud.                             *
*                                                                            *
* Provided Ruby has been successfully Paralyzed, you can now go ahead and    *
* have Cloud W-Summon Knights of the Round. The MP Turbo accompanied with    *
* Magic Plus should be enough to have Cloud hit for 9999 every hit, not to   *
* mention restoring half of Cloud's HP in the process with the HP Absorb     *
* combo.                                                                     *
*                                                                            *
* Next it's just a simple case of using Mime until it is dead. If it manages *
* to break free from its paralysis then don't hesitate to use more Dazers    *
* and Spider Webs (the Slow Status will prolong the Paralyzed Status),       *
* you'll then have to re-initiate the KOTR mime loop once more. After        *
* roughly 7 - 8 uses of KOTR, it'll finally start to flash red you'll be     *
* rewarded with the [DESERT ROSE] for your effort.                           *
*                                                                            *
*  NOTE - Using Dazers on Ruby will not 'reset' her paralysis; you must wait *
*         until she has broken free before inflicting her with Paralyze      *
*         again.                                                             *
*                                                                            *
%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%

 NOTES - The above strategy is by far the easiest (and by contrast the most
         popular), and is also by far the longest. There are alternative ways
         in which you can defeat Ruby that prove to be more of a challenge, if
         you're interested then goto section E.16 C.

       - You should now have unlocked the Ruby Render Trophy.

Now that you have defeated Ruby, head over to Kalm to talk to the Kalm
Traveller (eastern-most house). You can now exchange the Desert Rose for a
Gold Chocobo, after it's finished climbing the stairs you'll be able to run
over to it to name it. If you hadn't any room in your stables then it'll be
kept in your pen at the Chocobo Ranch for the time being. Note that this
Chocobo is a completely useless racing Chocobo.


EMERALD WEAPON:


  The first thing you are going to need to grab the Underwater Materia from
the Kalm Traveller if you hadn't already done so. Head through Junon until
you reach the sea bed, then Morph a Ghost Ship for the Guide Book. This can
be then be exchanged for the Underwater Materia (which will remove the 20
minute countdown timer when battling Emerald).

  NOTE - With the following strategy, you don't actually need the Underwater
         Materia, I was able to defeat him in 13 minutes. It's just handy to
         have equipped as a precautionary.

The preparation for Emerald is almost the same as Ruby, except you don't need
to kill off 2 of your characters and you don't need to worry about having any
Dazers or Spider Webs, although you would do well to bring around 20 Hero
Drinks with you into battle (remember that it raises one players Attack,
Defence, Magic and Magic Defence by 30%, and can be used up to four times in
battle for a maximum of 100%). Don't forget to slow the ATB gauge down all
the way.

You are going to want to make sure that each players Limit gauge is filled to
the max, after that you're going to want to give everyone Tranquilizers to
inflict them with Sadness. Now you're going to want to set yourself up with
the following:

 NOTE - The Phoenix Materia will fully revive all players, and will hit
        Emerald with Fire damage (Ruby absorbs Fire damage, so Phoenix is
        only good against Emerald). The downside is that it can only be used
        as many times as it has levelled up, and mastering a Phoenix Materia
        takes a lot longer than the Revive Materia.

The above set-up should max Cloud's Magic to 255, if not either equip a
Circlet or spend a little bit more time in the Gelnika. When you are ready,
save your game and jump in your submarine. Emerald WEAPON, here we come!!!
(It's about damn time.)

* Emerald Shoot - Used when its eyes are shut. Will cause around 7000 damage *
* to one character whilst also removing Barrier, MBarrier, Shield, Death     *
* Force and Resist.                                                          *

* Emerald Beam - Used when at least one eye is open. Will hit all players    *
* for 63% of their current HP whilst also removing Regen.                    *
*                                                                            *
* Revenge Stamp - Used as a counter attack when its eyes are open and will   *
* hit all players for roughly 2500 HP whilst also removing Haste.            *
*                                                                            *
* Aire Tam Storm - (Materia spelt backwards) Uncommonly used as a counter    *
* attack, Aire Tam will hit all players for 1111 HP PER MATERIA EQUIPPED! So *
* make sure to have Final Attack=Revive/Phoenix equipped. It will also       *
* remove nearly all positive Statuses.                                       *
*                                                                            *
* Blue Eye (A & D) - Damages one player for roughly 4000 HP                  *
*                                                                            *
* Yellow Eye (B & C) - Damages one player for roughly 650 MP                 *
*                                                                            *
* He also uses an unnamed attack called Foot Stamp which takes out roughly   *
* 2500HP to all characters. He'll only use this move if all eyes are shut.   *
*                                                                            *
* So long as you have followed the exact set-up as above you really          *
* shouldn't struggle, in fact I find it to be tremendously funny watching my *
* party go into counter attack overdrive mode every time they are attacked,  *
* and it's far more entertaining to watch than the KOTR + Mime strategy.     *
* Just keep using defensive moves whilst occasionally using Deathblow or a   *
* Limit Break, once he is finished you will receive the [EARTH HARP].        *
*                                                                            *
*  NOTES - One strategy is to use Lucky 7's to greatly damage Emerald. This  *
*          is activated by equipping a player with no more than 2 lots of    *
*          Materia, one of which being HP Plus (to make that persons HP      *
*          9999). When Emerald uses Aire Tam it will inflict 2222 worth of   *
*          damage, reducing the targets HP down to 7777, activating 7777     *
*          Fever. The combined damage won't be enough to kill Emerald, but   *
*          it will be enough to greatly damage it (it's worth pointing this  *
*          out just in case you were curious to see what Lucky 7's looked    *
*          like, if nothing else).                                           *
*                                                                            *
*        - Aire Tam will only be used if he's used two consecutive Emerald   *
*          Beams with all of the eyes open, or if he's used Revenge Stamp 10 *
*          times, or if he's taken 500,000 HP of damage from Knights of the  *
*          Round (with his eyes open). The easiest way to get him to use     *
*          Aire Tam is to wait until he has opened his eyes, kill all but    *
*          one of them (leave a yellow one alive) then just wait.            *
*                                                                            *

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--D3.04 E - Completion


  I've decided to split this final sub-section into lots of smaller sub-final
sub sections followed by a final ultimate final load out suggestion with lots
of smaller penultimate sub-suggestions finalising with one climatic great,
big.....

THANK YOU!!!

Thank you for taking the time to immerse yourself in the world that is Final
Fantasy VII once more (or for the first time), and thank you for choosing my
guide in which to enjoy it with. I hope I have been as helpful as I initially
set myself out to be, and I hope that you didn't find the game too easy as a
result of me being too overly helpful.

 NOTE - Other than obtaining 99,999,999 gil for the Coming Up All Nines
        Trophy, the following quests are completely optional and are only
        required if you'd really like to feel as though you've done
        absolutely every single thing that the game has to offer (aside from
        all of the 'custom' challenges that are out there, such as low-level
        challenges, 'Perfect Game' challenges etc).

1.) Mastering the last of your Materia.

  If you need to free up some Materia slots then DO NOT exchange your
  mastered Materia for the Master Materia at Bugenhagen's Observatory until
  you have the Materia Overlord Achievement. I suggest selling a few Counter
  Attacks, HP Plus's, Alls etc. Just *MAKE SURE* to leave one un-mastered
  copy in your inventory. I cannot stress this enough.

  I advise sticking with Cloud and Cid for their triple growth weapons, but
  feel free to swap Yuffie out if you wish. I whacked in Tifa and equipped
  her with the Powersoul which is double growth and will quadruple in attack
  power when equipped with the Curse Ring, and then double in attack power
  again when she has critical health for 8x her normal strength!

 NOTE - Materia Overlord Achievement. When you master a piece of Materia a
        check is performed to see if every other piece is mastered or not.
        This also checks to see if at least one Enemy Skill is completely
        filled and that the Master Magic, Master Command, Master Summon and
        Underwater are present, but doesn't check to see how much AP they
        have. You must also have the Materia either in your inventory or
        equipped onto a player, so if you'd sold, trashed or exchanged (at
        Bugenhagen's Observatory) any mastered piece then you would have to
        re-master that piece, unless you already have another copy mastered.

2.) Obtaining a second set of Master Materia.

  I suggest now heading over to Cosmo Canyon to exchange all of your
  mastered Magic, Summon, and some of your Command Materia for the Master
  Magic, Summon and Command Materia respectively. This should help you free
  up a load of inventory slots.

3.) Training until your heart is content in the Sunken Gelnika.

  Although a long-winded challenge, you could try and obtain enough Sources
  to max out your teams stats to 255. Should you wish to obtain a third and
  final of Master Materia set then I suggest working towards that now

  Those of the exploitive nature could always use the Extended W-Item Trick
  to max out their characters stats to 255!

4.) Training everyone up to level 99.

  You're still going to want to train in the swamp for this, those Magic Pots
  really do give out the most of EXP aswell as AP. Make sure to continuously
  level up all of your Materia again, excluding support and independent
  Materia.

5.) Obtaining you third set of Master Materia.

  Once you are ready head over to Bugenhagen's Observatory once more to
  exchange your Materia for a third set of Master Materia. Congratulations,
  you are now an FF VII God.

6.) Obtaining 99,999,999 gil.

  I saved this one till last so that you wouldn't have to spend as long
  grinding away, as you should be roughly 20 - 30% of the way towards your
  target. 98 Sylkis Greens will sell for 245,000 gil, so you'll net 1 million
  every four battles. You may be here for a little while... The other
  alternative is to master as many Alls as you can. The latter is probably
  the preferred strategy.

  Have you just earned the Coming Up All Nines Trophy? Then congrats - You've
  just also unlocked the platinum, Gaia's Guardian Trophy! Well done!

7.) Defeating the final bosses one last time.

  This is it, one final ultimate battle to end all battles. With every
  player at level 99, Bizarro and Safer Sephiroth will have the maximum amount
  of HP possible, and therefore posing the biggest challenge. Don't forget to
  cast Knights of The Round on Jenova-Synthesis to give Bizarro and Safer
  that extra boost in HP!
